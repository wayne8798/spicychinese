 hi, I have some question regarding the router. My router will be placed in living room. (cont) 
Just completed a 5.42 km run - Work   #RunKeeper
 how's the speed? I can get employee plan. $30 for 200mbps but I have doubts about their fibre broadband.
 which ISP are u using currently?
 not yet. I haven't send them the supporting documents yet. I heard the first batch of installation will begin in March.
 now it's a long wait for installation....
 yeah lo. I went for the dual AC router. Hope the speed will be as close to 1Gbps. Wired is not an option for me.
Just signed up for MyRepublic's 1Gbps Fibre Broadband. Hope it's as fast as advertised.
Another chalet this week. A completely different vibe from last week. Comfy vs Spooky.

You can only schedule a timing after the first failed delivery. And that means I have to wait till Monday which is far too long.
Here's the thing about DHL delivery for Apple products. You can't schedule a delivery timing as there's a lot of shipment.
