I guess my brain thinks that I'm living in US.
Jetlag 😭 that's why I can't sleep
RT : Story of my life. 
RT : sad but so true 
Thanks dad. 
Waiting for my new phone to come home.
It breaks my heart to see us falling apart. It hurts even more to see you standing beside another girl when I don't even have the chance.
Yea. I miss those days. When it feels like it's just you and me.
Remember when we used to talk every night? When we shared our secrets? When you just stay quiet when I'm crying madly through the phone?
I miss those days. I miss the old us. I miss you. 
Good night 😔
Have been sleeping at 5am plus a few days straight already. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
It's 4.45am and I'm still not sleeping.
Should I go? 
我又要顾虑他的感受 哎呀 烦 😔
不懂该不该去叻 好像很好玩 可是又不想弄脏自己 😔
FUCKING SIEN.
一個字 = 閑
還好意思睡覺
什麼鬼心情都沒完了
 I'm lazy to walk 🙈
It's 2.10pm and I'm still laying on the bed wondering should I continue sleeping or what. Lol.
RT : how I want to be right now 💏👌 
I don't know what the heck did I fucking did wrong. Urgh.
RT : Almost impossible. 
 看我這次能守這個承諾多久 😂
RT :  举双手双脚赞成🙋🙋💃💃

Michael kors watch and bag is gorgeous! 😭😭😭
Pandora bracelet so pretty ❤
情人節都過了 我的情人卻還在忙 還沒來陪我過情人節
Bitches saying that they love someone forever is like boys saying that they don't look at boobies. They fucking lie. HAHAHHAHA. What a slut.
Some delicious sweet chocolate all the way from Japan to satisfy my sweet tooth 🍫 
他還是很忙
很突然間的想吃巧克力蛋糕 😭 救命
我很悶啊 😢 他什麼時候才得空來找我 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Daddy asked me why I'm not going out lol 😣
喔 原來是她 你們兩個很 sweet 嘛 哈哈哈
總是那自己的缺點比人家的優點 搞到自己很自卑 卻怎樣都改不掉這習慣
听说外面很塞车 😅 我是不是该庆幸我待在家啊 🙊

Mr. Swee is busy. Me boring 😟
Receiving flowers are really really sweet. But it hurts to see them withered after a couple of days 😟…

Throwback at Cameron yesterday. The consequences of sleeping at 5am is having giant size eyebags 😓 
RT : “: When conversations end up this way after a few weeks or months... Hurts doesn't it ” &lt;/3
不懂事心理作用還是什麼 總覺得自己落頭髮落到快變地中海了 😢👴

Can't sleep. Aiks.
明知道我不喜歡骯骯髒髒的啦
明明就不夠高 卻死都要裝高 😒
生命太短 一分鐘都不要留給那些讓你不開心的人和事 ⌚ 
累死了 很眼睡 😪
一天到晚只會打機 不是不給你打 可是你也沒必要祇對著電腦打幾個小時咯 早知道給你一個人整理你東西 我留在家睡覺都好過在這裡當你的庸人。
That terrifying moment when you did not expect a thing but it just turn out that way. Idk how the fuck…
