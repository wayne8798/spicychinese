再美好的事物也经不住遗忘，再悲伤的过去也抵不过时间。
与其在风雨中去逃避，你不如在雷电中舞蹈，即便淋得透湿，也是领略生命的快意。
小时候我以为，不论什么错，一句对不起肯定能得到没关系。现在才发现，根本不是一句对不起和一句没关系的问题，而是就算过得去，却再也回不去了。
我不会让你伤心，如果有一天我不小心伤了你的心，你一定要相信，我会比你更伤心。
我需要一个能带我走的人。一个能带得走我的悲伤, 绝望, 不再相信爱情的理由的人。因为我现在就停留在这, 放也放不下, 走也走不开。
不知对你来说, 没有我的日子, 是否有一点点的想念着我 ? 就算是一点点, 就那么一点, 我也满足了。至少我知道在你心里, 我还存在着那么一点。

我们绕了这么一圈才遇到，我比谁都更明白你的重要。
其实我们身边有一种人，已经不是恋人，也并非朋友，时间虽然已经远去，但我们总能在某个不经意的瞬间习惯性的想起他，即使是曾经相恋但无奈的分手还是不愉快的经历，只是希望现在的他一切都好。
爱就是没有理由的心疼和不设前提的宽容。
在疼爱你的人面前，你永远只是个孩子。
驕必敗、傲必墜。
你想想你的现在和未来，你就知道现在该做什么不该做什么了。
破坏关系最简单的办法就是听信谣言。
维持一段感情，难免会觉得疲惫不堪，但累过后继续坚持，这才是真感情。
有的人对你好是，因为你对他好，有的人对你好是，因为懂得你的好。
