RT  Nothing feels better than having your cravings satisfied when you're extremely hungry.
RT  If you can reply them and not me, you dont deserve my reply too.
RT  It doesn't matter anymore
RT  ": Don't make me regret trusting you again."
RT : Is either we love or we hate.
RT  Happiness is a choice, not a result. Nothing will make you happy until you choose to be happy.
RT : school tomorrow

RT  Bastard that goes around finding girls to talk to is a major turn off.
