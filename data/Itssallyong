You are always on my mind
RT : I overthink way to much:(
RT : I think it's cute when you know that someone is making an effort to make you smile.
RT : Learn to appreciate what you have, before time makes you appreciate what you had.
RT : The first person you think of in the morning, or last person you think of at night, is either the cause of your happiness or…
RT : I get jealous. Don't touch, talk to, or flirt with what's mine.
Miss everything about you  😍
RT : Neck kissing always gets things started.
RT : Does anyone else feel like this sometimes 
RT : Who has had this dream ??? ??? 
RT : I'd rather hear your voice than read your text.
RT : Hate me for all i care. One day karma's gonna hit you so hard in the ass.
#mylove #smile #on #our #face #wednesday #night  #boyfriend #twin #chubbycheek

RT : Love it when people choose to stay with you no matter what happen
RT : I constantly wonder if I'm on your mind as much as you're on mine.
RT : #Virgos are very loyal and warm and sensitive towards the one they love.
RT : 我会用我一辈子的命来全心全意爱你
RT : #Virgo likes to see their relationship progress according to a larger plan.
RT : Girls who don't smoke, drink, party every weekend, sleep around, or start drama for attention. They are the true ladies.
RT : It's better to be hated for what you are than be loved for something you are not.
Lion dance everywhere
RT : One bad relationship could make you never want to fall in love again.
RT : "Sometimes the best way to forget about a person is to pretend you never met them before."
RT : That awkward moment when you forget how to spell a very easy word.
RT : Why feel sad about not getting anything special for valentines day ? When you meet that special someone , EVERYDAY is like…
Home&gt;Bathe&gt;Sleep
Shag

RT : Those player being the third parties just gtfo . Don't try to ruin "their" happiness .
RT : 别的人十句話
都不能傷到我
但你一句狠話
就能讓我撕心裂肺

能傷害我的
都是我愛的
RT : 爱情不是寻找共同点，而是学会尊重不同点。
RT : 我哭泣時、如果你懂
只要借我一個肩膀、靜靜陪我就夠了
RT : 只有微笑才能隐藏心里的痛。
RT : 每个人都有说不出的秘密。
RT : 一個人很悶就會亂想
想著想著，就哭了難過
RT : 我想让你知道，爱上你，我不曾后悔过。
RT : 如果你真的爱我，别再让我伤心了，好吗？
RT : 爱如果能说忘就忘，那我何必爱的那么辛苦。
RT : 永远太久了，要珍惜就乘现在。
RT : A relationship is more than finding the right person, its also about BEING the right person.
RT : I get so damn jealous when it comes to you.
RT : Once you lose someone, it's never exactly the same person who comes back.
RT : I have 3 sides.. 
RT : I want you permanently, not temporarily.
RT : Be careful about who you tell your secrets to, not everyone is looking out for you.
RT : I wish you could understand the way I feel about you.
RT : I really like.. ❤️ 
RT : A goodnight text from you can make my night. ❤️☺️
RT : The best relationship is when you can act like lovers and bestfriends at the same time ♥

RT : The worst feeling is regretting not having done something when you had the chance.
RT : If your girlfriend is pretty &amp; alot of guys want her, thats another reason to treat her right. At least you got what they…
RT : Sometimes, you gave up on someone. Not because you don't care but because they don't.
RT : If someone doesn't see you in their future, maybe it's time for you to put them in your past.

Love the way you love and dote on me~

RT : fucking m1 just now keep no service
RT : ": What's yours, will be yours. What's not yours, will never be yours."
Whats wrong with the M1 service?!
RT : When I date someone, I think long term. What's the point of dating someone if you only want them temporarily?
What should i do?? #stress
RT : Beauty isn't about having a pretty face. It's about having a pretty mind, a pretty heart, and a pretty soul.
RT : If he misses you, he'll call. If he cares, he'll show it. If not, he can't be worth your time because you're obviously not wo…
RT : A person that truly loves you will never let you go, no matter how hard the situation is.
RT : You were born an original, so don't die a copy.
RT : Find someone who isn't afraid to admit that they miss you.
RT : No guy is worth your tears, and when you find the one who is, he won't make you cry.
RT : When you accept someone, you need to accept their past too.
RT : Overthinking kills happiness. Insecurities kills self-esteem. Lies kills trust.
RT : The only people you need in life are the ones that need you in theirs.
RT : What comes easy, won't last. What lasts, won't come easy.
RT :  😍😍 the same apply to you! Heehee ^_^

Gonna survive for the next three days 😔😔
Today is just the first day and im so tired and cant stand the crowd !!!
New year to me is nothing
RT : I gave you my heart for a reason. Because I trusted you not to break it.
RT : 越长大，我发现现在能信任的人越少。😂
RT : Why am i so lazy..
RT : Somewhere, someone is looking for someone exactly like you.
RT : I love my cute bf alot. Hehe :)

RT : 人們看人只看外表
很少人能夠真正了解你
My typo gan jialat
RT : Call me old fashioned, but I actually take relationships seriously.
RT : I’m just thankful for the people that never left.
RT : Learn to appreciate. Don't only know you love someone only when you'd let him/her go.
Confirm will have a sweet dream tonight
Doing all this isnt enough
K im stupid at this stuff
RT : 我不贪心。只有一个小小的愿望：生命中永远有你。
RT : 有的人，该忘就忘了吧，人家不在乎你，又何必委屈自己呢？再怎么痛，再怎么难过，人家也看不到，也不会心疼你，你难过给谁看？
RT : 有些人，就是仗着你爱他，所以一次次欺负你。因为他知道，不管怎么样你都不会走的，你都会原谅他。而你呢，光会生气，光会哭，可死活不懂当断则断该分手要果断分。一个人如果已经不爱你了，又为什么要忍他呢？伤你有多重，就离他有多远。真的，爱人不如爱自己。
RT : 有時候
會突然心情不好
不想跟別人講話

會突然很傷心 
想好好的哭一夜

但是被別人看穿心情時
總愛逞強說『我沒事』
RT : 我很想告诉你、我好想你⋯
可是我怕得到的只是一个简单的回答“哦”字⋯
RT : 真正喜欢一个人，怎么甘心做朋友。
RT : 你总会碰到一个人，他口口声声说爱你，却无时无刻不让你伤心难过。
RT : I’m the type of girl who looks at the menu for five minutes but ends up ordering the same exact thing every time
RT : The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone.
RT : I've liked u since i met you.
Too rush to plan
RT : I just want to be your first pirioity.
If thats the case, then why are you choosing me in the first place?
You are the only one that i want to be with
RT : It's hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone, when your heart still does.
Hard time for us to leave each other
Phone left 27% how to survive until i end work sia !!
RT : One day I'm going to wake up, roll over on my side, and kiss the love of my life good morning.
RT : I don’t understand how some people can look good every single day
RT : Yes, I'm thinking about you right now.
How i wish you were giving it to me ..
Sian sia
RT : #Virgo is not perfect. They'll annoy u, make fun of u, say stupid things, but u'll never find someone who loves u as much as…
RT :  ^_^ ^_^
RT : I hate guys who think they can get any girl.. 😩😠
 ofcause i knw uh!!^^
RT :  thanks for waking me up despite being busy! You know i love you right? 😙😙
How long do we have to continue like this?
Do you miss jacket?? 😂😂
RT : I'm falling for you more and more. I really hope you'll be there to catch me.
RT : #Virgo wants to be yours not one of yours.
RT : Small things that mean a lot: Cute texts, tight hugs, long replies, holding hands, remembering the little things,&amp; kisse…
RT : i need your love &amp; care.
RT : Stay strong. Even when it feels like everything is falling apart.
Touching my hair every single minute
Troublesome and irritating hair but i just love the way they trouble me
RT : true friends don't need Facebook to know when's your birthday
RT : It takes a lot for me to trust someone.
RT : Cuddles aren’t complete without touching of the booty
Im the most noisy person in store &gt;&lt;
laughter start whenever i step into the store
RT : when you see a girl flirting with the guy you like 😒 
Saw a fat bitch early in the morning #suey
Your just too slow larhx
You knw ur standard still wanna stand inside !!
Rojak convo in bus ?? K can
RT : No matter how strong a girl is, she has a weak point. And sometimes, all she needs is a hug.
就好是越早离开越好
RT : Fucking hate it.
Cb larhx knn mood sibei fuckedup leh!!!!!!!
Bitch means bitch ..
就好是不要在我面前seek attention larhx horhx .. Erxinnnn~
Knn trying to attract attention uh?? #bitchplease
RT : 因为爱错～
 superhappy de
 huh citibank de
RT : 亲爱的，你总是问我在想些什么啊，我笑着对你摇头说，没什么。那些都是真的。我只是喜欢静静地坐在你的身边不论是看日落或是看日出 你有一种让我犹如深呼吸以后放松的魔力。尽管我们也会争吵。不过都会和好如初。我一直觉得我们就该在一起。我从来没有想过要和你分手…
RT : 人和人相遇，靠的是一点缘分；人和人相处，靠的是一点诚意。这世间，没有谁对不起谁，只有谁不懂得珍惜谁。
RT : 少在我背后讨论我，闭上你的鸟嘴，我没那么多故事让你讲述。
RT : 当爱上某个人时，脑子的功能有时停顿得彻底 ， 没办法思考其他事情，也无法专注心志，只会重复回想那些相处的细节，呆坐着傻笑回忆往往可以消磨许多时间，琢磨那些对方说过的话语和展露的表情。
RT : 你不是最帅最美的
但你是我最爱的

你不是最好的
却是我最在乎的
RT : 我的笑可以给任何一个人，但我心只能给一人。
RT : 两个人在一起，并不是要两个人每时每刻都粘在一起，是为了让自己知道，在这世上还有一个人爱着自己。
RT : 给我一个机会好好的爱你
RT : 有些记忆就算是忘不掉， 也要假装记不起。
You came today !!
