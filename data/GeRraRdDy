為她努力工作學習就好

能多陪她就好

他們不必每天在一起
恩愛就好♥

RT : 回眸13的往昔，犹如一个斑斓的梦，每一处都在浅笑中暗香盈袖，每一处都在轻舞霓裳里温暖安然，每一丝气息都在记忆中不离不弃，仿佛经岁月留下的点点滴滴都触手可及。款款真情在13里与14做着最后的交接，那即离即别的情感像不舍的情人在分别的刹那用十里…

I appreciate every single good thing you've done for me, but you never know how I feel deep inside 😔
I was born in this shape by you, beating educated by you, family hurt by you, and now even relationship hurt by you.
You never know how your words hurt me 😔
Sometimes I wish I could leave you and let a better one goes into your life.
我知道自己真的是个很失败的男朋友，我无法每分每秒都陪在你身边，无法每天给你拥抱，无法每一晚在你睡觉前给你一个吻，无法在你身边跟你说晚安，无法在你需要我的时候出现在你身边，更没办法在你不留意的时候惊喜地出现在你身边，我真的不够好，但我真的很努力，想做个及格的男朋友 😔
Calling you but no answer 😔
I wish I could stay beside her 😔
Baby sleeps quite well I guess 😘😘
