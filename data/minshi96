要永远记得这个教训
只怪自己笨
真正对我好的人我不珍惜,直到失去了才知道他多重要
  晚安

Everytime when i look back our  previous conversation,tears will be shed slowly..
RT : When I miss you, I read our old conversations, listen to songs that reminds me of you, then miss you more.

 他收不到
I miss you I need you and I love you.
I know what u like and what u hate. But I duno what u want and what u think.
