One thing every girl/woman should learn: confront their mistake.
 than 31. Get it?
 the amount of the sweets you have start to count from 31. But if you throw away the sweets you have. You'll end up have less

Applied spectroscopy is kinda hard. Need to self-study ASAP.
 (cont) the amount of fat stored. Fats stored previously won't burn by itself. Let alone the fact that fat is so light.
 nah. Extra calorie consumed is stored as fat. If you just decrease the intake of the calorie, you just decrease (cont)
 eating clean won't make you lose weight, a balanced diet (or you call it eating clean) + workout will.
