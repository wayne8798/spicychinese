 错了，不好意思。正确的应该是：懒得理你。
 懒的理你，是这句话么？这句话有不要跟我骄傲的意思。
 我还是没有明白，你可以用英文表达。你不要跟我骄傲，似乎没有两个字，或者一个词组就能表达整句话的意思。不过不排除一些新生词语。;P
 很多人缺少的就是自知之明，这不奇怪。还有很多人不愿意承认自己的缺点。也都是有目共睹的~~
  It's so cute
 懒析？没有这个词啊。你想表达什么？
 没办法啊~~~只有默认，或者避开。
 不露脸的家伙

 你应该让Will明白中国的法律并不是那么严格。只要他不招惹麻烦的话，没有任何警察愿意主动检查他的签证。除了入境处的警察。而且天朝是欢迎他们到来的。
  many cops couldn't speak English and do not want to deal with any one. unless you make trouble in our place.
  The fucking goverment like foreigners because you can bring money to them and very very welcome business man.
  Bro i had told you, there is not any cop wants to check what your visa is, when you walking anywhere.
