RT " 一個賣瓷碗的老人挑著扁擔在路上走著，突然一個瓷碗掉到地上摔碎了，但是老人頭也不回地繼續向前走。

路人看到覺得很奇怪，便問：『為什麼你的碗摔碎了你卻不看一下呢？』
老人答到：『我再怎麼回頭看，碗還是碎的啊。』

過去的事情就應該放下
未來的生活才會沒有負擔 " 👍👍👍👍

RT : 心理學家發現：

一個人說的話若90%以上是廢話
他就快樂

若廢話不足50%
快樂感則不足

在交流中
沒有太強目的性的語言
更容易讓人親近。

所以 我們每天都在找＂幸福＂
幸福是什麼呢？

大概就是找到了
一個願意聽你說廢話的人

我愛我的家❤️🏡
不管怎麼樣，世上總有一個地方是你能放心依靠、放聲大哭、開懷大笑，并永遠都想要待在那裡的。
那就是溫暖的家。在那裡，你可以放膽的做任何事，不需要在乎別人的眼光，也能擁有爸爸媽媽的呵護。
家是避難所；是每個人最熟悉的地方。🏠❤️
