 It's a penalty and a red card. The rule books says so. Szczesny was the last man, contact was made. No brainer. #ssn
 No chance. Bayern are extremely strong at home. Lost to City was a one-off. But Bayern will win comfortably. 2-0

Sterling's progression is incredible. At this rate, he can be a truly world class winger.
Impressed by the Ox. Incredible game for Arsenal. Motm for me. For Liverpool, Sterling was immense. He was Liverpool's best player.
Football is about taking your chances.Regardless of whatever referring decisions you dont get,if you dont take your chances,you get punished
Of course we only have ourselves to blame for not being clinical enough and for defending slackly.
Its as good as saying. You are a diver, so even if you get a kungfu kick in the box, you still dont get the penalty.
Just because you have dived in the past does not mean that you shouldnt get a penalty at all.
No, i dont buy that shit. Referees are there to make a decision. Reputation must never come into play.
Sighx.The thing about ref is that after they make a mistake,the team suffers.U cant turned back the decision and u just have to suck it up..

Really bitter to lose this game. But time to focus on the league now. And we must defend better!
This is a painful defeat. I swear..
Arsenal played much better but we really dont deserve to lose at all. Zzz
Dont deserve to lose at all wtf. The penalty decision cant be ignored seriously!
Must say that the officiating in this season is really really poor. Too many bad decisions.. Zzz
Its really as if decisions are up to the ref. If he doesnt want to give the pen, you dont get it. Regardless of whether its a legit claim.
Regardless of how Suarez might have fell, that was a stone wall penalty!
