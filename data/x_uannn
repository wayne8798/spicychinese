讓心跳停了　我們就到這裡 分手本來就不該會有結局 我靜靜的換氣　瞬間失去了力氣
Does that means that I should shut myself out the world?
Lol? Phone auto shut down?
我不習慣喊痛 只是我習慣忍痛
作了個夢　夢裡沒想過會有落空 醒來的時候 隨著疼痛 眼眶泛紅 其實不懂　怎樣才算有始有終 主角離開後 默默的劇終 卻不為所動
Lies.
Drink and get drunk 🍺😪
Sneak out later? 😏👍 Hahaha!
Can I go out now and chill the night away, just sit at the void deck, listen to my song and blank my mind?
Let's put on some quiet emo song and let the feeling out ~
Bed like rubbish bin, everything put on my bed. Waaaa, fuck.
GBM?
RT : I could eat this everyday! 😩😍🙌🍴 
Even when I already say, "I bring her go my room sleep, cos it's too noisy". Yet still don't auto a bit -.-
When your mood is damn bad, and all the idiot still gambling over at your place like as if is their house. Cb.
Just too cute. 😍 
Gonna mia myself from the world from now until Monday when I'm back to work.
Off mode. Silenttttttt ~
It is dropping.
Let's wait &amp; see.
CISBU?
I give up.
Probably that's how I felt.
RT : ": I don't know why but this year Chinese New Year I feel so emo"
RT : Words are cheap.
RT : Lol this CNY is boring.
Still can't get rid of the thought that we ain't compatible. 😕
静静的，一个人，哭了，就算了。
I need to get myself a stuffed toy soon 😏
Just done bathing, feel refreshed now.
有时候，我会觉得，还是一个人的生活适合我。可能因为有了孩子，所孩子变成了生活中央，让我的生活一切都变了。😌
Meimei, please get well soon. It hurts me so badly to see you in a sick look 😔 No longer my smiley baby anymore.
Hopefully both girls will continue napping ~ at least they won't be that cranky.
I very the no mood, hopefully all won't cranky mode already.
I knew confirm buay song one.
Really is spoil all the mood lo!
Ayer, a bit sian now. 😪
Thank you babe! RT :  thats great! (: last long babe!
So glad that Le'Bear is such a understanding man. 👍 And he has been doing a great job as a man to me and my daughters!
Thank you  for hearing me ranting last night ❤️

#Throwback last night with Le'Bear for movie date (: 
I really do hope that meimei will be better after inserting the medicine! 😩
Sleepy max ~
RT : What I feel for you, I've never felt for anyone else.
Okay, time for bed 😴
Left a few hours to sleep. 😪
And I've to admit that our mindset is totally different. :/
It did bother me, but I just kept quiet &amp; let it down. Because I guess probably, that's how it used to be.
RT : LOL unknowingly it's 2am now. I still thought that it's only 12 midnight. 😑
Not until I find myself a way to answer the question to myself.
Should I bring it up? Or just keep quiet? 😐 But I don't wanna bring any argument. Never mind, shall not than. 😅
Pray that the girls will not be cranky~
Tomorrow confirm zombie mode ~
Feel uncomfortable about it, but I think it's pretty normal? Mm, or is it not? 😕
On the phone w Le'Bear ~
1st Feb'14// Happy 8 months old, Sherrine Meimei! ❤️ I'm glad that I made that decision to give birth… 
I smile each time when I know that our love has changed for the good. :')

#Loveofmylife #cny2014 #day1 
When looking at the babies sleep, I fell asleep too &gt;&lt;
Just when I thought .
Lucky we are all home.
Should I go watch a movie !? 😏
One thing I dislike about CNY. "Where's your husband?" "why he never come?"
Damn stupid, for what argue over a zodiac? -.-
I rather go watch movie ~
Yawn. Hopefully we won't stay too long over at the place. Sian ttm &gt;&lt;

 Haha. If only I can ? My mom want me go ah.
Both girls already bathe. I haven't.
No feel for visiting at all. Can I just skip it and stay home with my girls?
I'm lazy to shower ~
Waking up non stop to just pee. 😪
Feeling all tired and don't feel like going anywhere bt just nua in bed ~
RT : Be honest with me. That's all I ask for.
Don't feel like going for CNY at all. No feel for it anymore like I do.
RT : I feel nothing for this cny😟
RT : All good friendship begin with "I thought you were a bitch when I first met you"
Tomorrow confirm tired 😂
RT : Most idiotic conversation ever. "You asking my girl out?" And he went, "ya." Wtf?!
Haha,I think so! RT   i think he purely retarded.
So that guy stupidly asked permission from my bear to date me out for dinner? WTF?! 😂😅 To laugh or cry?
Why is Le'Bear so cute ? 😍
After that bus ride, everything between us change. It has become better, I felt.
I guess I ain't like before anymore, can no longer get angry with you even when I hear your voice.
I never like Chinese New Year, it's always a curse to me.
我不習慣喊痛 我的心早已千瘡百孔　 
只是我習慣忍痛
I never thought that it would be that hurting.
Shall head to bed now.
我不習慣喊痛 我不是只有無動於衷 　 也曾經告訴他　我傷得有多重  我能給多少包容
Thank you ah~
On a Chinese New Year some more ..
Damn fucked up now.
If -.- means unhappy, I am so -.- x100000~
I feel like I'm boiling inside -.-
別說我不懂 你決定要走 就不要回頭 別說我不懂
Okay, can.
LOL. "I love you for 9 years liao lei" -.-
你是我的電源 乾涸我的雨天 一點一滴帶走每一天 對你的狂戀 你是我的電源 絕緣我的思念 能不能趕在愛變質前 誰都不准說再見
為我畫的愛心握在我的手心 我多想在你這裡
Downloading song. Time to update the playlist, and then update the lyrics and album too ~
一秒鐘像一千年 愛過才能體會 沒盡頭的世界 千萬別說再見 就算是幻覺 也要把這瞬間 愛得 很美
一秒鐘像一千年 你讓我太想念 永遠也不算永遠 千萬別說抱歉
Right side of my stomach hurts like shit.
