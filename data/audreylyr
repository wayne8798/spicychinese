I have given so much to only realise I was wrong all the while.

Why do people always take things for granted? Why must we only look back when something is missing? Human Nature or what.
Right now I am really grateful to being busy from work. Keeps my mind busy from over thinking. Goodnight!
I think we need a break. Yes, maybe we should.
Sense of security? Sorry don't know what's that, did it even existed?

So the HR miscalculated my pay. Nb.
无聊的星期六！
I'm at Shaw Theatres -  (Singapore) w/ 6 others 
TGIF!
用期待加上宽容，再加无止尽乐观和等候。以为这些付出可以美好结果。你却说，凭什么。。。
不痛不痛，心却独自跳得好寂寞。
Feeling super duper sleepy.
Happy friday! Happy people!
I do. 
And I don't know why must people share it. Not helping dude!
What the hell is going on with facebook these days. Everytime I log on, am greeted by a naked model.
And I have to self appraisal first . Why??  My biggest weakness is I don't know how to rate myself.
So this month is confirmation month..
I'm at Bugis+ (Singapore) w/ 4 others 
偏偏要爱到万剑穿了心，才肯死心。
偏偏我越抱越紧，偏偏我越爱越贪心。
Bad mood !!!!!
I'm at Pico Creative Centre (Singapore) 
And I always had all, constantly.
The most helpless pain is toothache, stomachache and menstrual cramp.
Toothache!!
Dang dang dang dang!
Then you look into your bag and found out makeup pouch at home.
Worst scenario when ur colleague look at u and say "Eh you forget draw your brows"
I cannot believe I actually forgot to draw my eyebrows, happily boarded bus went to work.
Pandora or Vulcan?

And I hate lunch so much. Always feeling sleepy after the meal. Even desperate because coffee not doing it's job. Argh!
I don't understand why Monday is always mundane. Seems like a pattern.
Yay yay yay!!!! TWIST TWIST!
Yay. Finally hit town today with W! Seems like this town is total stranger.
Mini birthday breakfast for all the January babies #mymummy &amp; #mybrother nicholasbryanli #foodporn… 
Personally I feel, everybody deserve respect. P.s not that I swing my hair and walk away.
But. I got a death stare. Like really death stare.
It's just a light kick on to her crutches. Then I apologise repeatedly.. in English and Chinese (scared she don't understand )
Okay so I was looking around for a toilet in bedok mall, accidentally bump onto a elderly woman with crutches, no she didn't fell.
Cannot help but I cannot stop comparing.
And the people here is very uncoorperative. Esp the guard, GL ttm.
That is why they always say. An event without a issue is not an event.
Don't even have time for my mummy's birthday (which is today)
No time for sleep. No time for breakfast. No time for friends.
Sometimes I don't know why am I working so hard for?
Not my day.
Hungry until faint
 oh. Cheh. Hahaha
Cny no feel.
Feel so lethargic for work tomorrow. Oh god!
 lol. What about it?

So what If you have your own business. Doesn't give you all rights to act "like a boss". you know what? You wont go far.
And basic respect means when someone is having a conversation with you, give them all your attention.
Some people really have to learn about basic respect.

": Idiot Audrey. Keep show off here and there. Cheh. Pui. 😒😒🔫🔫" Hahaha!
可是冥冥中，我知道你是爱我的。
有时候你让我觉得我很孤单，很孤单。
有时候我觉得你的梦想里，没有我。有时候我觉得你的计划里，没有我。
