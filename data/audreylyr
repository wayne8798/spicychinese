偏偏要爱到万剑穿了心，才肯死心。
偏偏我越抱越紧，偏偏我越爱越贪心。
Bad mood !!!!!
I'm at Pico Creative Centre (Singapore) 
And I always had all, constantly.
The most helpless pain is toothache, stomachache and menstrual cramp.
Toothache!!
Dang dang dang dang!
Then you look into your bag and found out makeup pouch at home.
Worst scenario when ur colleague look at u and say "Eh you forget draw your brows"
I cannot believe I actually forgot to draw my eyebrows, happily boarded bus went to work.
Pandora or Vulcan?
I can't believe CNY just ended like this. 😭😭😭 good time always passing so fast.
Raging on cny eve.
I can explode anytime.

Courtship and relationship. Same same but different.
 I only ate one pao. Lol.
Now, teach me how to survive mondays..
And I hate lunch so much. Always feeling sleepy after the meal. Even desperate because coffee not doing it's job. Argh!
I don't understand why Monday is always mundane. Seems like a pattern.
Yay yay yay!!!! TWIST TWIST!
Yay. Finally hit town today with W! Seems like this town is total stranger.
Mini birthday breakfast for all the January babies #mymummy &amp; #mybrother nicholasbryanli #foodporn… 
Personally I feel, everybody deserve respect. P.s not that I swing my hair and walk away.
But. I got a death stare. Like really death stare.
It's just a light kick on to her crutches. Then I apologise repeatedly.. in English and Chinese (scared she don't understand )
Okay so I was looking around for a toilet in bedok mall, accidentally bump onto a elderly woman with crutches, no she didn't fell.
Cannot help but I cannot stop comparing.
And the people here is very uncoorperative. Esp the guard, GL ttm.
That is why they always say. An event without a issue is not an event.
Don't even have time for my mummy's birthday (which is today)
No time for sleep. No time for breakfast. No time for friends.
Sometimes I don't know why am I working so hard for?
Not my day.
Hungry until faint
 oh. Cheh. Hahaha
Cny no feel.
Feel so lethargic for work tomorrow. Oh god!
 lol. What about it?

So what If you have your own business. Doesn't give you all rights to act "like a boss". you know what? You wont go far.
And basic respect means when someone is having a conversation with you, give them all your attention.
Some people really have to learn about basic respect.

可是冥冥中，我知道你是爱我的。
有时候你让我觉得我很孤单，很孤单。
有时候我觉得你的梦想里，没有我。有时候我觉得你的计划里，没有我。
