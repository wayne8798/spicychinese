RT : 老船說 這海上我都看過
老船說 這海浪我都觸摸過
老船說 這海我都聆聽過
生活我已全然看透 
Because you all are my strength.
TO BE INDEPENDENT AND PROACTIVE.
Feel like don't wanna open my eyes.
Pleas go smooth, please.
What goes around, comes around
Did someone tell you that you're very annoying before?! FED UP! Get away from my sight pleaseeee!
Do you know...
I don't 😢
Two more weeks to be at Japan, but sadly it does also mean that I gonna leave soon😢😢
I could forget all about it
Yea finally it left 20 days!
I touch the air,  touch the air too, I touch  😄
Sinful and shameful
Made up mind. I wish I'm doing right thing and making thing right.
Ohmine hectic week is going to begin soon! 😩
What's the trouble on your mind? #sodagreen
Urgh when I can throw my braces behind! Tuesday blue💭💬
and guess what how I live without these &amp; those
So this is your reaction.. Disappointments come and go but life still moves on. #Unexpected
Work is basically just counting the hours
ONE MORE MONTH TO BE AT JAPAN!!! 🎉🎊🇯🇵💮✈️🗻🗾🚄♨️🍙🍣🍱🍥🍜🎎
Good people deserve good things. Sadly, life doesn't always work that way.
Silent.
nostalgia &amp; imagine of something that never happened
my heart sleep walks into yours.
I wanna know that I mean something in somebody's life. The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I lived. That I made a difference.
Goodmorning November.
Why don't I? Tell him only what. #Brave
I just want to ignore those irritating problems.
Won't you flyyyyyyy with me
這綿延的故事還未了
人生一場大夢 夜落不覺曉 
don't wanna leave, but. 😢😢😢😢😢
Walking down this memory lane, remembering the good, the bad and what could have been. And if I crash, please pick up my brain.
every piece of you..
there are far better things ahead than we leave behind.
and  I always will remember all, the strength you gave to me
if you want to fight back, fight with yourself and your thoughts in the night. #StopNaggingPlease
The gap between my imagination and reality..
the worst feeling is you know what you should do yet lack of courageous
Humans are just too complicated.
You're one of the five people I meet in heaven.
I kept quiet and spoke to you in a thousand silent ways.
JUST HOW.
It was a beautiful yet cruel mistake to begin with you...
I could offer you a warm embrace, to make you feel love.
I'm totally lack of passion in this co. and should submit my letter now right...
May you live better after this, I'm sorry my little-Agnes.
once again m trying not to feel anything. it's a bit disturbing how easily it comes
跌倒谷底，還是在家洗衣就好。
WHY and WHAT he did to me!!!! FED UP!!!! Bloody idiot!
心底真的很難過的時候就會想用文字抒發 只是我不明白 為甚麼從來支持你的都不會是同一屋簷下的人 而是你的同事你的經理你的阿姨 然後能夠靜下來用心聆聽的到底剩下幾個 一個還是兩個 有蹊蹺卻用揶揄的口氣責備的人又有多少個
我是真的很累，無從寄。
FED UP
Oh I'm sorry, I'm kinda allergic to bullshit.
你知道我不想離開
你知道我有多無奈 
相思欲寄無從寄 畫一個一個圈兒替
cuteness overload, I'd die...
accept my flaws and all..
If I could do anything, I would do everything... and so I did.
It's a stay at office Saturday with nothing to do... Time have to pass faster uuhh!
逝者已矣來者犹可追
I'm weak indeed
Freaking running nose ruin my night! iishhh
BAHAHA, just give him a smile. Chill😃
Reality is always there to slap me in the face, HARD.
Yeaaaa I'm going to Japan!!!!!!
Somebody disappointed me, seriously.
Finally gonna knock off in awhile! 🎉
The fault in our stars.
What a tiring journey! 😫
WTF WHY ARE THEY BEING SO SELFISH!
Gotta back to the reality in awhile.
But right now I wish you were here. 
Wtf why are the two bloody idiots speak so loudly behind me in the BUS! Grrrr
Hopefully your day will go well, good day to you!!
Liking this quiet little Sunday night.. Gotta sleep earlier😴
Goodmorning. I'm on your runway, and I'll never wanna come back.
If I could reached the stars, I'd pull one down for you. Baby if I could change the world, I would be the sunlight in your universe. #ifonly
I understand the conflict between my head and my heart
Understand that you don't have to understand everything.
And I loved you with my glass heart.
what is what should never be
It's cruel enough to realize what you can do for the one is just so little.
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending
If you give someone your all, what will you be left with?
Goodmorning October. A very happy birthday to my super marvelous bro!! Have a blast! :)
Sometimes, I wish I could read your mind. Then I wonder, if I could handle the truth.
Hopefully the days will go well
My thoughts are irrelevant shits.
In retrospect, you'll always realize who cares and who doesn't.
Things are happening around you, not to you.
at night my mind walks.
How cold it can be! Gloves &amp; stockings aren't work for me!! Die... 
Saturday night ruin by my body clock. Please don't get sick! 😷😷
Happy Birthday to you, #Confucius
"I'm all that you need, and you're not falling quietly."
Am feeling sick😷😷
Never let the moments slip away.
Dilemmas, Hmph!
Why won't this day just end already
And it's hard to love when there's so much to hate. Maybe we should all be praying for time.
My Thursday ruin by the sorts of irresponsible people. Damn.
It's raining dragons and dinosaurs.
Words are knife, that can stab through a heart. 
Who's there to safe the hero, after he saved the world?
I saw something that reminded me of you just now. But don't worry, I flushed and everything went back to normal.
Is time moving too fast or are you moving too slow?
One song; Thousand memories.
SORE THROAT!
The very first time chit-chatting with small lim since I was here for ady 6 months. Liang nan!
Just relax to the maxxxxxx! Sozai time with JEE!
Sunday has this "don't do anything productive" vibe to it.

So damn tired! Time has to pass faster and faster! 😴
It saddened me that I have to leave "here" at the end of December, but.
明白的不說也明白，不明白的說了也不明白。

Wheee! iOS7 is just awesome!
You're the superb in my eyes.
Upsetting isn't it?
URGH why am I always hungry on this timing! ineedfoodddd #foreverhungry
The awkward moment.. When you've already said 'what?' three times and still have no idea what the person said, so you just agree. #wonder
勝之不武，嘖嘖。
我在南極 憧憬你的北極星
我知道，另一個平行時空裡，我們是在一起的。
只是目前無法消化，你深不可測。

#mondayblues
天若有情天亦老，道是無晴卻有晴。
Can somebody tell me what's going on? JUST WHY.
I hear your voice
知道了！ 
Just why.
心不動，則不痛。

不知道是我在看著你還是你在注視著我。
生命的同花順 底牌沒有你 我也認
My-forever-favorite for the day! No more Thursday blueeeee! *wink*
Cheeryouup,mysuperbro. 
你的存在是為了和我一起閱讀一本悲傷的書籍。
#Confucius
好多話想跟好多人說...
Exactly. This time I'll make you proud.
Full of tiredness after busying for whole day yet satisfied with the outcome. #welldone
你是臥龍還是鳳雛？你問。
都不是，在下徐庶。我答。

哈哈，謝謝我是你的徐庶，主公有何指教呢，在下願意為您效勞！

你要釋懷喔，晚安家兄，真的辛苦了！
