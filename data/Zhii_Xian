RT : Shit happens, I mean look at you.
RT : The key to a successful relationship is to be with someone who wants you just as much as you want them.

RT : In the eyes of a child, you will see the world as it should be.
RT : I do miss you, but I'm trying my best to stop caring.
RT : Honestly, I don't need someone who sees the good in me. I need someone who sees the bad in me and still wants me.

RT : 七年，可以彻底忘记一个人。科学家说 ，不管有多么深刻的伤痛，只需要七年都会痊愈，因为七年的时间可以把我们全身的细胞都更换掉，一个旧细胞都没有，每一天的坚持都是一种进步，每过一天，那些想念你的细胞就会死掉一些，总有一天，会干干净净。
RT : 多年以后，我们都长大了。经过谎言，承受欺骗，习惯敷衍，忘记誓言，放下了一切。世界惩罚了我们的天真，磨损了我们的梦。但内心还是不断地闭合，勇敢地开放，一往无前地爱。既然无法得到，索性就放手成长吧。年少的忧伤是人生必经的花园。
RT : 哭过就好了 伤都会好的
RT : Caring too much only fucks you over.
RT : If you don't make mistakes, you aren't really trying.
RT : Cuddling with you would be perfect right now.
RT : I want to see you happy, but I wanna be the reason why.
RT : 把所有的不快给昨天，把所有的希望给明天，把所有的努力给今天。
RT : 世上最心痛的距离，不是你冷漠的说你已不在意，而是你放手了，我却永远活在遗憾里，不能忘记；世上最心痛的距离，不是我活在遗憾里，不能忘记，而是你始终不懂我的悲哀，不明白我内心的孤寂；世上最心痛的距离，不是你不懂我的悲哀，不明白我的孤寂，而是我…
RT : Nobody’s perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. But some mistakes will teach you great lessons and make you a better person.
RT : If you ignore me, I will ignore you. If you don't start the conversation, we won't talk. If you don't put in the effort, …
有些话不要说的太早，说出来做不到，连我都替你感到羞耻.
RT : true friends don’t judge each other

they judge other people

Morning :*
RT : Don't take life too seriously. You'll never get out of it alive.

RT : 如果你认为Facebook当年花10亿美元收购仅有13名员工的Instagram是疯狂的举动，那么告诉你，今天Facebook以190亿美元收购了不到50名员工的WhatsApp。平均每位员工分得近4亿美元。#感受一下

RT : Unfortunately, we all have that one person we'd take back any second... no matter how much they hurt us in the past
RT : 再大的伤痛，睡一觉就把它忘了。背着昨天追赶明天，会累坏了每一个当下。边走边忘，才能感受到每一个迎面而来的幸福。烦恼不过夜，健忘才幸福。  
RT : Less friends, less bullshit.
RT : 有一天你会明白 人不能太善良 老好人是受欺负的 因为人们只会挑软柿子捏 他们只会得寸进尺 如果事事都太大度和宽容 别人也不会感激你 而是蹬鼻子上脸 有时候应该适当的有点脾气 对待有些人真不能太温柔和忍耐 因为过分善良也是傻逼
RT : I won't wait around for you to decide whether i'm worth it or not.
Nights !
RT : 有时像患了忧郁症一样，会突然心情不好。 偶尔像患了自闭症似的，会突然不想说话。你有这种感觉么？
RT : “: 一个人突然联系你了，正常，他在找备胎。
突然不联系你了，也正常，你只是个备胎。
有一天又联系你了，更正常，你是一个好备胎。
接着又不联系你了，依然正常，有比你好的备胎出现！” 👍
RT : 我说别再联系，你就真的连一句挽留都没有。我一个人发没有人回的短信 ，写没人看的日志 ，我有太多不甘心，喜欢你真的好委屈。
RT : If a girl asks you a question, its better to just give her the truth, chances are she's asking you because she already know…
RT : I forgive some people even if they don't deserve it, just so I'll have them in my life.
RT : You still make me smile, even if you are the main reason why I'm sad.
RT : Do u ever become friends with someone and then u get to know them and its like no wait I don't like u can we stop this f…
RT : 什么是情人节？可以吃的吗？
“: 你是否有四个模样：一个是在朋友面前疯癫的样子，一个是在恋人面前完美的样子，一个是只身一人时脆弱的样子，还有一个，是在陌生的人群中安安静静的样子。”
RT : Your my EX for a reason.
RT : Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
RT : Nowadays "I love you" seems easier to say than "I like you"
“: Behind my smile, there is something you'll never understand.”
RT : My past is my past, I've made mistakes but I have learned from them too.
RT : I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, make you mad but put all that aside...You'll never find someone who cares and loves you mo…
RT : 总觉得朋友越来越少了。
RT : Fuck you, you fucking fuck.
RT : If you asked me how many times you have crossed my mind, i would say once because you never really left.
RT : Don't cry. Just say "f*ck you" and smile.
RT : 曾經
很愛一個人
我會把每天的
心情短信告訴他

現在
也偶爾寫
不過不會發
只會寫了改、改了刪
然後發現寫還不如不寫

最後
一個字也沒有留
回頭看看當時的自己
覺得有點好笑
Totally bad mood.
I hate you !
RT : 你相信吗？友情世界里也存在着吃醋，那滋味不亚于爱情
“: It kinda sucks when people don't realize how much you care about them.”
RT : A jealous girl is a faithful girl.
Yes my wrong my wrong :D
“: 愛情就像鬼 相信的人多 遇見的人少”
RT : "I'm sorry" and "Thank you" are powerful words that the weak keep avoiding.
RT : The eyes are useless if the heart is blind.
What am I waiting for now?
Just a text from u 😏
No more angry (:
“: A text from you would be great right now” :(
RT : I don't want perfect, I want worth it.
RT : I want to be the girl who makes your bad days better and who makes you say my life has changed since I've been with her.
RT : 有的人把心都掏给你了，你却假装没看见， 因为你不喜欢。有的人把你的心都掏了，你还假装不疼，因为你爱 。
RT : 女孩，别干撕照片，烧信，撕日记这样一类三流爱情电视剧中才有人干的事。相信爱情。相信好男人还存在，还未婚，还在茫茫人海中寻觅你。别说“男人没一个好东西”这样使别人误以为你阅人无数的话。
“: 如果说剪掉头发就是剪掉回忆，那我剪成光头是不是可以失忆”
RT : 女孩，照镜子的时候，一定要微笑，跟自己说，我很可爱。要运动，要健康，不懒惰，不吸烟。不要晚睡晚起。爱物质，适当地。永远知道精神更重要。比那些名表，名牌，时装，更加美丽的是你自己。
RT : 所谓成熟，是明明就该哭就该闹，却不言不语的微笑。
RT : A real boyfriend sees no other females because he only has eyes for his girl.
RT : Fix the problem, not the blame.
RT : 睡着睡着就哭醒了，这是出生；哭着哭着就睡着了，这是人生。 想哭的时候却不得不笑，想笑的时候却反倒落泪了，好多人就这么过了一生。——眼泪，是活着的证明。微笑，是活着的方向。所以每个人都追求的幸福是：哭着哭着就笑了...
“: If it still hurts, you still care..”
RT : 要原谅一个人，很简单。
可是要再次相信，很难。
RT : 保佑上帝把他留给我？哈哈！
RT : I’m not jealous, I just don’t like that bitch.
RT : The longer the explanation, the bigger the lie.
RT : Even seeing your name makes me smile.
RT : I hate when people think I'm in a bad mood just because I'm being quiet.
RT : Don't chase people. Be you, do your own thing and work hard.. The right people who belong in your life will come to you…
RT : 我很想你，而我能做的只有沉默。
Everything will be fine soon (: S-M-I-L-E it's another day again and you are still alive .
忘了吧.
学校见 .
