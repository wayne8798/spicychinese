#nowplaying Sky Ferreira - I Blame Myself 
 I'm 16! Born in August~
 if I'm ur little brother, I'd be so grateful to have a sister like u. U r really nice and considerate.
 OKAY. Sadly, its our goodbye tonight, ain't it?
 I can't just fly from China and do anything to u, u know that, right? Haha
 r u sleepy yet? I remember its like 22:00 London time.
 I wouldn't treat u any differently just because ur age. So don't worry about it.
 I'm not. I just genially don't get why you'd be upset about ppl knowing ur age and I do wanna go back to 8yrs.
 God, if I can, I'd go back to when I was 8 yrs old. I mean it.
 u don't remember? We talked about it~
 Yeah. But if you see China's social media, you'll be amazed how people r treating each other, that's why I left those places.
 When I was 14, I wasn't smart and sane like you. I feel ashamed.
 search Tyler Oakley and you'll see so many direcioners saying stuff like"I'm so happy Tyler got kicked out of fandom by lian
 that's exactly what I thought when I saw his marathon tweets...... But directioners seem to love those, haha
 Directioners should think like you do. I don't know why people like to be extreme.
 True.
 Yes. But I don't he's going to.
 Yes, I totally agree. I guess when u get famous, ur inside changes somehow. The way you think...
 Not picking sides. Tyler should've wait a little a longer to react to liam's tweet but Liam made me speechless.
 Its been crazy good. The drama, OMG, gotta love it. U should definitely check it out on iTunes maybe?
 Did you watch "Revenge" recently?
 I mean,if u apologized afterwards with nice attitude,its okayBut look at Liam's twitter page, I can't believe they r from him.
 And I don't see any family values...
 His dad said very nasty things about homosexuals and was really extreme about it, like talking about violence...
 he's a extremely homophobic reality star's son. Liam liked them and support their "family values".
 this is what Liam tweeted. 
 u know this place?
 Harbin, a city that's very near with Russia and North Korea, very cold, saw so many foreign travelers.

 I've had an okay new year, being on flights a lot, met a really cute European guy for 3 seconds:-)
Why do u need a 800W or 1300W front camera to take a selfie? How cute u must look!

  And he's not apologizing, what r u talking about~
  R u the same person that did the "rejecting suicide" video? These words sound very not logical or wise~
  Just cause he's a fan,so he can't get offended?Ppl often b misread as racist they just gotta prove they aren't
 He's not homophobic I think, but he's definitely inconsiderate of what he says at what point and had hurt some of his fans.
  No, that's not really true. If he wants to stay relevant in this business, he can't.
The screen on@Nokia Lumia 1520 has some issues with its new Assertive Display tech,in low lights,u can clearly see the flashes on the screen
The area where I live only has HSPDA to connect with, I want H+ rather than 4G cause it's much more realistic.

 Relax, it's just a term Africans love to use~
 Yes. Stay positive. I told myself everyday~
 Haha. It's a very true message though~
 I'd freak out in a positive way. It's like, so hot! I might not be able to keep it in my pants! Lol
 Yes. Totally. I just wished Katy could apologize, it'll make her such a nice person~
 Str8 guys loves 2 see 2 girls kissing and feel like it's not hard 4 girls 2 do that, but they wouldn't kiss another guy~
 If u see male twins were lovers, what'd b ur reaction?
 what I meant was, once I realized something I said was offensive, I'd either apologize or not let it come out~
 When u see 2 girls kissing in"truth or dare",u feel like it's okay,normal,it's not hard,but when it's 2 guys?Totally different
 I would've apologized 4 the song because I hurt the feelings of so many of my fans, but katy didn't, wah, wah
 Yes. I think the reason that people think that way is because this is still a straight male's world. But it's getting better~
 It's brave? If it's me, I'll just keep in my head, I mean, if I have a huge gay following~
 I tweeted earlier, in majority's mind "girl on girl= more femininity" "guy on guy=feminism" weird logic~
 One thing's clear, she didn't meant to hurt gay people, but she's using the word as an insult toward her exboyfriend
 So fun, there's not a word to describe it, oh, well, I guess LOL~
 Ik. I'll try. I know people uses the word gay as a stereotype adjective, it's just, I hoped more of her~
 Ik. Still love her, but feels weird inside~ I'm such a Rationality fan~
 I love the song "Girl Gone Wild" off her newest album MDNA~ it's basically my life lol
 It's just, when u love someone, and they did something that kind of hurt u, it's a weird feeling~
 U know, katy performed UR SO GAY in a high school, I'm like, u know bullies love to use the term, right? So still encouraging?
 Read this article and u'll know why I have such a strong opinion on the song~ 
 I know her as well, but I don't know her work~
 Hope she won't sing "U r so gay"~ lol
 recommend u to listen to a song by Celine Dion called "Thank You", it's how I feel about people like you~
 people thinks all gay guys like Madonna, Barbara Streisand, Liza Manale, but I'm too young to know them~
 OK. Then I'll choose Celine Dion to be my third queen, love her new album to death, haven't heard any of her previous albums
