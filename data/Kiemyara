日久生情，才是真的缘份。喜欢你的人，要你的现在。爱你的人，要你的未来。真正的爱情，不是一见钟情，而是日久生情；真正的缘份，不是上天的安排，而是你的主动；真正的关心，不是你认为好的就要求她改变，而是她的改变你是第一个发现 #quote
If you tell me the truth, I'm gonna be mad but ill get over it. If you lie to me I'm never gonna be able to trust you again. Your choice!
I really hate that "not good enough" feeling.
All I need is someone who can stay no matter how hard it is to be with me.
Ops. Forgot to buy oxyfresh antioxidant for Brandy yesterday. Nowadays act like an old folk. #forgetful
Just taught Brandy new trick :) she learnt in few minutes. Brilliant! Loving her intelligence.
Maybe I can shop a little after getting the shoe :D
Looking at the wounds on my body parts, thinking imma too smart to be injured.
Not those selfish people but idk how to describe her. She just never consider about the others. #idontlikeythiskindofattitude
I just want one relationship, with no cheating, no lying, no ex's getting in the way.
Bad day ahead. Out of mood.
Bunch of works waiting for me. Great.
什么叫真正的放下？就是有一天，当你再次面对你过往的难堪、你憎恨恼怒的人，心如止水，不再起心动念，坦然面对，一笑了之。即便别人在你面前，复述你过往种种不幸时，你仿佛是在听别人的故事，心里一丝涟漪都没有了。放下，莫过如此。
多少难熬的我都熬过去了，如今的我不闻不问不痛不痒又凭什么不快乐。
The moment she walks into the hall, I feel like weeping
Not so bad after all
If you love her, you won't even care about "winning/losing". YOU JUST LET HER WIN. Unfair? Too bad, you're a man (unless you're just a boy)
What's Mickey without Minnie, what's Piglet without Pooh, what's Donald without Daisy, that's me without you.
Love is made by trust, respect, and caring.
Don't feel bad, somebody out there is making a mistake too. Nobody's perfect.
RT : Be happy. Be who you wanna be. If others doesn't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasi…
