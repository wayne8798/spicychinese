有年情人節，男友興高采烈送咗一紥玫瑰同幾支好燦爛嘅紫色花俾我；後來同朋友講，原來佢男友都試過送佢同一種花，結果兩個人都笑到停唔到。「好彩佢唔係送俾我媽媽咋！」好燦爛嗰幾支，係拜山的菊花。#湊鬼 #LOL

 "queen of punk" &gt; 崩后
 有啲係公司 standard 要全中或全英；通常我會建議個客考慮吓唔好譯某啲字或 phrase 因為會兀突
 靜電
 龐克係台灣的。Vivienne Westwood 香港叫佢「崩后」，但大部分本地媒體一係唔知 punk 係點的，一係就直接用 "punk," 所以一定要譯的話，朋或龐都唔係香港的，唔重要
 朋克係大陸

 雙重標準，工廈嘅以「風險導向」原則打擊；住宅內就發牌，低能。
屋宇處會以「風險導向」為原則，加強遁查會有劏房嘅工業大廈。但會審慎處理住宅大廈內嘅劏房 #施政報告 ＃CYLeung #HK 即係點？雙重標準？
係我廣東話退步，定係 CY Leung 講嘢廢？「必須」、「我喺度諗」、「政府會盡力」、「政府會加快」、「只要各界支持」... 即係無實際解決辦法啦 #EpicFail #族政報告 #HK

    口衰講句，咁多小朋友自殺都係咁嚟。香港教育制度太唔健康太恐怖
   但老老實實，有啲小朋友夾硬入到所謂名校，結果讀得超辛苦超唔開心，有咩為？
   我哋嗰個年代都唔興名校，而家咁搞法，下一代要入好學校嘅門檻實在太高
   男女拔嗰啲唔係掛？
 總之就神啦，可恨我手殘 lol
  唔係一路都係咁嘅咩？中學嗰時好多同學一係有個家姐一係媽媽阿姨以前讀同一間學校。cc 埋  先，係咪囡囡都升中學啦？
