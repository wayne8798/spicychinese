你的心有一道墙~ jjlin 心墙
如果心有一道墙,那只有自己能跨过它吧。 为何我被牵连呢?
如果那就是你所谓的尊重,那么我还能说什么呢?
如果对不起就能化解所有的伤害, 那么为何还有人会受到心理的伤呢?

有时还是会有迷惘与低落的时刻,但路还是要走, 活还是要干, 心情还是要收拾。希望自己会更好! 我没事! 加油。 
人们都有许多面脸。我们的性格也是如此,但我们是否能接受其它的观念也只有我们自己才能做到。心里的那道墙,那道门,那道锁着的窗 是否能解开呢? 只有自己知道吧。
 心事确实很多。没关系,我没事,还好^^
听到  的叶子, 觉得里头的的歌词真的可以描述我的心情。 很久没这样了。
  thks bro ^^
 暂时没事了。有事时,我再说吧。现在不能这样。 ^^
心里的煎熬。
我没事?
