這說明了
你怎樣對待別人別人就怎樣對待你的這狗屁理論是他媽的錯誤

明天妳睡覺我煮火鍋吃

決定了
我真的搞不懂我室友
明明她每次睡覺 我都會出去樓下做我的功課 
或是能盡量不發出聲音打擾她睡覺
第二天若是早晨上課 前一天晚上會收拾書包
。。。
她倒好
明知我明天早晨830課
我在睡覺她還煮泡菜面吃
。。。。。。。。。。。
哦 好吧 我也餓了
心有多執著 就加倍心痛
...
好喜歡這裡 
。。。。。。。。。
好喜歡 
我想 只是害怕清醒
明天要考試我一點都不緊張反而還在擺弄我的ledi粘土@@ 
不見棺材不落淚
真的
其實孤獨並不陪伴著我
。。。只是我一直在追尋它

@@
用燒烤黏土做的。。。

我好像很空閒的樣子 
剛回來新加坡
呼
心情好複雜
Failures are a part of life. If you don’t fall, you don’t learn. If you don’t learn, you’ll never change.

People say words don't hurt, but if I threw a dictionary at you it would.
RT @RelatableNotes: That awkward little dance your thumbs do when you don’t know how to reply to someones text…
@TheReasonBehind awkward conversation
是不是你有深愛的［兩個她］ 
所以你不想再讓自己無法自拔
直到妳想通 他早已經不再對你留戀 
最後的妳 ～開始了一段掙扎
直到愛消失 你才懂得去珍惜身邊每個 
美好風景 ～只是他早已離去
@TheReasonBehind 你深愛他 這是每個人都知道啊~

你讓我夢見了太美的夢
生命中不可承受的輕
你證明了每一顆流星
都遙不可及
你因為了我每個所以
所以了這一百年孤寂
你灑下默默無言的雨一滴
一滴一滴一滴滴遺忘的淚滴
It’s useless to show how much you care for that special someone, when that person is too busy getting someone else's attention.
以前我不懂得未必明天就有以后
你知道我會有多難過
所以 即使到最後 還微笑著 要我幸福
你縱說 時間還很多 你可以等我

“@MyNotesBook:Being called weird is like being called Limited Edition. Meaning you're something people don't see that often. Remember that.”
Trust is such a big word. It takes a lifetime to create it, but you can lose it in a second by a single mistake.
In relationship, honesty and trust must exist. If they don't, there's no point of loving, so if you can't afford to be honest, stay single.

Don't rush. Just wait for someone worth being in a relationship with, stop wasting your time on the one's who don't deserve you.
