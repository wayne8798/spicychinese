“: why dont i have a cute boy to cuddle” same
WHY IS EVERYONE POSTING SELFIES
RT : "Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you'd have preferred to talk."
Justin's hoodie phase was the shit though.
"Justin’s releasing another perfume? Nigga must think we stink."
 Is the red-head ??? :)
Syncing my iPod at 2.07am. Not a very good idea.
"bizzle" sounds so bad stop
Justin is so amazing I'm so utterly grateful for his existence.
RT :  this isnt work. this is being creative. doing what i love. music
CHECK YO DMS 
I'm such a creep. 👀
 sorry i'm hella annoying but you look perfectly fine in your shots photos in my opinion :)

RT : 'bizzlers' pls stop
Justin should really start following real Beliebers to be hella honest.
Ew why did Justin follow that Asian asshole who stans Selena and shades him all the time?
 You should really consider following ,  and .
RT : Make someone smile today.
RT : Ready to destroy some food. Come at me bro 🍔🍟

Did a Bieber hater really say I sounded like a 12-year-old Belieber on Facebook that day? Like, wow, just goes to show how ignorant you are.
I miss watching Justin live so much. :(
"Malaysia, I love you," *bows* "Goodnight!" *waves* -
I MISS YOU  :( 
SO CUTE OH MY GOD 
I don't know if I'm late but did anyone notice that Justin changed his Instagram username?
I hate the fact that I'm such a boring person, especially when I'm not with people I'm really close to.

 Hahahahah what's the point then??
30k tweets woah derrr
Explosive. 💣
 Probably because I'm in college &amp; all? :/ Or maybe I'll just leave my account here? Although everyone'll probably unfollow me.
 :(
 I'll think about it...
But obviously no one will want it because of the number of followers I have considering the fact that I never buy followers...
Or I was thinking of giving this account away (plus my Justin follow)...
I'm thinking of deactivating...
RT : don't you hate when everyone finds you attractive EXCEPT THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE like why
RT : Stay Productive.
Excuse me but am I the only one fangirling over 's Snapchat because he looks so cute???

Messy.
Okay.
Just woke up &amp; scrolled through my timeline &amp; it's all about how y'all are calling Chantel ugly &amp; how Justin's hanging out with the Beadles.
