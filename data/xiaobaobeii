找女朋友要找155-165的,有着长长的头发,可爱帶点美丽,不瘦不肥抱起来有肉感,笨笨的笑起来很甜,在你面前不顾任何形象,喜欢黏着你,偶尔一点小孩气和小霸道,帶的出街又帶的回来,拒绝暧昧只爱你一个,不嫌弃你任何缺點,体谅开心理解包容你,要让他知道你很爱很爱她,不是能用言语表达的!
每天在他家赌钱。不想做工了。

I was there for you, remember that.
有时候，恋人分手，女孩哭得要死要活。其实，还真说不出男人哪里好，她就是觉得从此天崩地裂一般的崩溃，觉得再也遇不到那样的人了。更多时候，我想，女孩不是在乎那个男人有多好，而在乎的是自己在他身上付出的多少时光和心血，就像自己苦心经营的一座城池，轰然倒塌，那种心痛的无助感。

The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes and weaknesses and still thinks you're completely amazing.
People are quick to believe the bad things they hear about good people.
Don't ruin other people's happiness just because you can't find your own.
When you have someone special in your life, don't ruin it by making stupid decisions.
Every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is if you still want to be together when things go wrong.
goodnight !
yeah ! 放工了
Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience and two people getting through all the hard times together.
Use your smile to change the world, don't let the world change your smile.
Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually.
just reach , so.full ! chilling night (@ yoongchi sweet room♥) 
Relationships last when both of you give it your all. Never hold back and never hold secrets from each other.
Being called babe or baby is just a really good feeling. 😍
drama time ! (@ yoongchi sweet room♥)

真的是给你炸到够够力-_-#

Once you stop chasing the wrong things, the right ones catch you.

If you don't want me, don't mess with my feelings.

Love is the most beautiful thing to have, hardest thing to earn and most hurtful thing to lose.
Maybe I'm too late to be your first. But right now, I'm preparing myself to be your last.
 lolzz , no pick up phone

头晕晕，眼花花，睡觉了 。
Bye Bye (@ Slimming Sanctuary) 
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost.
Laugh when you can, Apologize when you should and let go of what you can't change.

狮子座伤心时，不会大声痛哭，也很少找朋友倾诉，狮子座往往会把自己关在家，一个人默默地发呆，什么也不做，什么工作学业都可以暂时抛到脑后，狮子座外表看起来是那么平静，心可能却在流血。狮子座又像是一个收藏家，哪怕这件事已经过去了好多年，当突然又想起时，伤心依然是难免。
其实身边很多人不懂巨蟹，很多时候的好心总是被人误解。用心的付出，用心的爱却总是被别人浪费，甚至嘲笑。很多时候觉得自己不停的扮演着小丑的角色希望身边的人开心。可最后发现人家真的只是把你当小丑。而不是朋友！你们是不是真的以为无论说什么巨蟹都不会伤心？
One smile, can start a friendship.One word, can end a fight. One look, can save a relationship. One person can change your life.
Love doesn't need to be perfect, it just need to be true.
. ok lur
伤离别 (@ Slimming Sanctuary) 
I don't care how attractive you are. If your personality is ugly, so are you.
Never cry for someone who hurts you, just smile and say "thanks for giving me a chance to find someone better than you.
Give thanks for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
 hahaha forget
She comes off as strong, but maybe she fell asleep crying. She acts like nothing is wrong, but maybe she's just really good at lying.
It takes 2 seconds to say I love you but it takes a lifetime of trust and respect to prove it true.
Anyone can make you smile, but only someone special can make you happy.
Don't wait for the Last Judgment.  It happens every day.
goodnight :)
   将早结婚干嘛啊
 哈哈哈，问而已啊
    看谁忘记谁先啊
 在哪里？
tired
    看到时有没有联络啦
heyyyy ! goodmorning ? haha
我的工作很充实 😄
She wants a hug. Not just a normal hug, one of those tight hugs that take her breath away, give her butterflies &amp; make her smile like crazy.
I hate that feeling in the morning when I’m so sleepy but I have to force my self to wake up early and get ready for work
goodnight :) !

我只是想从你身上拿点安慰而已，可是你都没给我，没关系吧
A year ago, I would've never guessed life would be the way it is now.
Saying that you're okay is so much easier rather than explaining all the reasons why you're not.
Don't put a limit on anything for yourself. The bigger you dream, the farther you will go.
When I see my phone light up, I always hope that it's a text message from you.
无言
The past is like an anchor holding us back. You have to let go of who you are to become who you will be.
heyy morning ! 睡不好的一晚
Life isn't about having things to enjoy life. It's about enjoying life with the things you have.
A disciplined mind leads to happiness, and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering.
Single doesn't always mean lonely and Relationship doesn't always mean happy.
It hurts when you want someone you can't have. It hurts even more when you've lost someone you've once had.
 blekkk
wohoo ,.sleep
莫名其妙的 怪怪的伤心
hou sweet ahh !
There's always that one special person that no matter what they've done to you, you still, just cant let them go.
 哈哈哈，做么奇幻
Everybody wants a second chance, but not everybody deserves one...! 
Everybody wants a second chance, but not everybody deserves one.
You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings.
Unexpected text messages are always nice. The fact that the person took a little bit of their time to make you smile.
Love is a beautiful thing. It comes with hurt, it comes with pain, but there's always sunshine after the rain.
I'm at Slimming Sanctuary (Mid Valley City, Kuala Lumpur) 
goodnight ! :) (@ yoongchi sweet room♥) 
I'm not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am.
Every day is a chance to be better than the day before.
can u pretend im not ugly and annoying and fall in love with me
As long as you're still the same person I fell for, my feelings won't ever change.
If two people are meant to be together, they will eventually find their way back into each other's arms, no matter what.
我想好好享受的休息 ，累垮我了
Thinking about you is so addicting , honey

Never be afraid to start over, It's a new chance to rebuild what you want.
i love how men mock women for being overemotional and then lose their shit over a team losing an over-glorified game of fetch
