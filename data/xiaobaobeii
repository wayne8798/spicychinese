Bye Bye (@ Slimming Sanctuary) 
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost.
Laugh when you can, Apologize when you should and let go of what you can't change.

狮子座伤心时，不会大声痛哭，也很少找朋友倾诉，狮子座往往会把自己关在家，一个人默默地发呆，什么也不做，什么工作学业都可以暂时抛到脑后，狮子座外表看起来是那么平静，心可能却在流血。狮子座又像是一个收藏家，哪怕这件事已经过去了好多年，当突然又想起时，伤心依然是难免。
其实身边很多人不懂巨蟹，很多时候的好心总是被人误解。用心的付出，用心的爱却总是被别人浪费，甚至嘲笑。很多时候觉得自己不停的扮演着小丑的角色希望身边的人开心。可最后发现人家真的只是把你当小丑。而不是朋友！你们是不是真的以为无论说什么巨蟹都不会伤心？
One smile, can start a friendship.One word, can end a fight. One look, can save a relationship. One person can change your life.
Love doesn't need to be perfect, it just need to be true.
. ok lur

I don't care how attractive you are. If your personality is ugly, so are you.
Never cry for someone who hurts you, just smile and say "thanks for giving me a chance to find someone better than you.
Give thanks for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
 hahaha forget
She comes off as strong, but maybe she fell asleep crying. She acts like nothing is wrong, but maybe she's just really good at lying.
It takes 2 seconds to say I love you but it takes a lifetime of trust and respect to prove it true.
Anyone can make you smile, but only someone special can make you happy.
Don't wait for the Last Judgment.  It happens every day.
goodnight :)
   将早结婚干嘛啊
 哈哈哈，问而已啊
    看谁忘记谁先啊
 在哪里？
tired
    看到时有没有联络啦
heyyyy ! goodmorning ? haha
我的工作很充实 😄
She wants a hug. Not just a normal hug, one of those tight hugs that take her breath away, give her butterflies &amp; make her smile like crazy.
I hate that feeling in the morning when I’m so sleepy but I have to force my self to wake up early and get ready for work

A year ago, I would've never guessed life would be the way it is now.
Saying that you're okay is so much easier rather than explaining all the reasons why you're not.
Don't put a limit on anything for yourself. The bigger you dream, the farther you will go.
When I see my phone light up, I always hope that it's a text message from you.
无言
The past is like an anchor holding us back. You have to let go of who you are to become who you will be.
heyy morning ! 睡不好的一晚
Life isn't about having things to enjoy life. It's about enjoying life with the things you have.
A disciplined mind leads to happiness, and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering.
Single doesn't always mean lonely and Relationship doesn't always mean happy.
It hurts when you want someone you can't have. It hurts even more when you've lost someone you've once had.
 blekkk
wohoo ,.sleep
莫名其妙的 怪怪的伤心
hou sweet ahh !
There's always that one special person that no matter what they've done to you, you still, just cant let them go.
 哈哈哈，做么奇幻
Everybody wants a second chance, but not everybody deserves one...! 
Everybody wants a second chance, but not everybody deserves one.
You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings.
Unexpected text messages are always nice. The fact that the person took a little bit of their time to make you smile.
Love is a beautiful thing. It comes with hurt, it comes with pain, but there's always sunshine after the rain.

goodnight ! :) (@ yoongchi sweet room♥) 
I'm not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am.
Every day is a chance to be better than the day before.
can u pretend im not ugly and annoying and fall in love with me
As long as you're still the same person I fell for, my feelings won't ever change.
If two people are meant to be together, they will eventually find their way back into each other's arms, no matter what.
我想好好享受的休息 ，累垮我了

Never be afraid to start over, It's a new chance to rebuild what you want.
i love how men mock women for being overemotional and then lose their shit over a team losing an over-glorified game of fetch

Take the time to see and appreciate what you have.
She ignores all the other guys who want her, because she’s too busy noticing the one she wants.

You have no idea how much I like you, how much you make me smile, how much I love talking to you, or how much I wish you were mine.

The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited, or erased. It can only be accepted.

": Dear Past, thank you for your lessons. Dear Future, I'm ready. Dear God, thank you for another chance.
I’m going to smile like nothing is wrong, talk like everything is perfect, act like it’s all a dream, and pretend like it’s not hurting me.
don't apologize unless you're going to change the shit you're sorry for.
Best thing about being single? No drama, no fighting, no crying, no feelings, no confusion, no worries and no problems.
多谢你的绝情，让我学会死心。等待你的关心，等到我关上了心。走完同一条街，回到两个世界。谁把谁当真，谁为谁心疼。是你苍白了我的等待，讽刺了我的执着。我不想再为过去而挣扎，我不想再为思念而牵挂，我不想再为你卑微自己了。也许,失去了你，我才会得到更多。放手，是最好的解脱。

afternoon
I want to refresh my mind, clear all my problems and just have fun with life.
Never get too attached to anyone unless they also feel the same towards you, because one sided expectations can mentally destroy you.
drama
morning 👏
I don't need someone who thinks I'm perfect.. cause I'm not. I need someone who knows I'll make mistakes and still love me for it.
Honestly, l feel really stupid for holding on to things that just keep on hurting me.
One of the most amazing feelings in the world is having someone fall in love with you who you thought you never had a chance with.
I seriously over think everything, which makes me stress myself out and create problems that weren't even there in the first place
That moment when you can actually feel the pain in your chest from hearing something or seeing something that breaks your heart.
The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
Learn to appreciate what you have, before time makes you appreciate what you had.
i find it really weird how we can talk to ourselves in our head like how does that even work
When a girl is acting like she doesn't care about you anymore, that's when she needs you the most.
A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is.
Never waste time looking for the perfect lover. Instead, try to create the perfect love.
It's unbelievable how fast people can change. One day, you mean everything. The next day, you dont exist anymore.
drama#enjoy# (@ Taman Abadi Indah) 
Your boyfriend isn't "gay" just because he's doing cute, silly things to make you smile. If anything, he's just trying to make you happy. 🙏
Even though I promised myself I wouldn't risk the chance of getting hurt again, for some reason, when I'm with you, it all seems worth it.
When girls cry about one thing, they end up crying about everything that's wrong.
世界上总是有那么几个傻瓜，一直在等那些没有结局的结局。
想说的话，尽量说出来。什么话都埋在心里，过些时间就会发现，已经没有了想说的冲动。两个人，不言不语，时间久了，连开口都需要勇气。感情就是这样逐渐变淡、直至没有了痕迹。
Relationships takes TWO people. Not one person being faithful and another acting single.
Stop editing your pics. What if you go missing ? How can we find you if you look like Beyonce on Facebook, and Waka Flocka in person.

When a girl gives up, it's not because she doesn't love you, but because she's tired of getting hurt &amp; feels like you'll never care.
GOODNIGHT
