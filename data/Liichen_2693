Last minute decide, heading to TM 拜年 with Dear's 大哥 大嫂 二哥 二嫂 :)
Don't know what my dear want for valentine's gift :x
RT : 一个好男人, 在有女朋友的时候, 应该像紧锁的门, 不管外面有什么美女敲门, 都毫不动摇, 不给人希望。而很多男人, 虽然有女友, 却依然开着门缝, 让追求者一直留有希望。男人一直留有机会, 当然是桃花满天飞。所以找男人, 就要找能给自己美好…

RT : 双子座都有些双重的性格，外露越冷的双子，内里就越像个小精灵，很可爱的。但可惜的是她的这点很少能被外人看到，甚至父母都看不到，但是作为她的爱人、作为她最在乎的人，她就可以轻易的在他面前展露自己的另一面，调皮可爱的性格便会跑出来。我只能说 …
