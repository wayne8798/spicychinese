Today, I'm officially missing you.
It becomes difficult to get someone off your mind when that person is thinking about you at the same time.
I wish to tell you "I've finally grown up" I've changed lot after you walk out from my life. And, you're still the one I'm thinking of.
You know yourself well there is a person you will never forget nor let them go off from your heart. There's always a place for him in ur ❤️
Dear ex,I wish to ask you badly do you regret to let me walk away from your life?From everything become nothing,from lover become stranger.
There's always a person you know his shoulder is the most comfortable and the right one to let you count on him of everything.
He was bad enough to broke my heart and you're strong enough to cure me from the heartbroken. But I'm the cruel one to take it for granted
Dear ex, you will never know how hard I feel at this moment when I recall back all those sweet moment while with you. It's hurt but sweet.
There's a person appeared in my life. He brought me laughter, happiness and love.He has turned my life became a colorful rainbow. But now..
For you I will become a better me.
Boy, I miss u. Your eyes was attracting me when you look at me.
I found it is unspeakably attractive when a man has an attractive eyes and he definitely can take my heart away.
When I close my eyes you're all I see
One thing for real, my life wouldn't be the same without you because my whole world revolves around you.
No matter where I go, every road leads me back to you.

RT : I remember my first day on twitter..I was like, "What the fuck is this shit?"

每一個非分之想都是受傷的開始
People always ask this question to themselves: "Why am I being so silly to mess up with you in this kind of situation?"
Sometime I ask myself what kind of relationship we are in ? Not a friend not yet a couple ?
RT : My tweet wasn't really about you. 

But if the shoe fits, then lace that bitch up and wear it.
RT : I'm single but I know who I want.
Relationships should help you, not hurt you. Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be.
Perhaps, I'm ain't the one beside u when u're in very difficult moment,but am hoping that I'll by your side in present for every tough mmnt.
So close yet so far. &lt;/3
I'm sad, hurt, angry, mad, disappointed. But you know what? I'll put on a happy face and move on. It will hurt but I will survive.
RT : One man's LOL is another man's WTF
RT @LetsQuoteComedy: my tweet wasn't really about you. but if the shoe fits, then lace that bitch up and wear it.
Let's tell me what I should do after I have noticed of that? What kind of ending I should write for myself?
寫/說的人不負責任，看/聽的人又何必當真。
Am need to stop doing permanent things for temporary people.
Recovering .....
I should know that, I shouldn't ..
I believe things will get better when you least expect.
I know you more than what I thought. Feel so awesome. :)
When get hurt, learn to be strong; When people leave you alone, learn to be independent. 💪
I don't react doesn't mean I didn't notice of it.
Please don't expect me to always be good, kind and loving. There are times when I'll be cold and thoughtless, and hard to understand.
Never will forget those previous days that have you in my life.
women tend to keep their feelings to themselves because they're tired of pouring their hearts out to the wrong person.
Ironically, the more you hide your feelings, the more they show. The more you deny them, the more they grow.
You're always the only reason .....
You would never know I pray in every day just for your appearance again and we could have a happy &amp; happiness love story that never end.
You're still the only reason that make me smile and happy like an idiot although you're the reason make me sad and cry.
Trust me,knowing you is the best thing ever happened in my life. For me,You're the greatest gift from God. I wish our story will never end.
I'm sorry for being a coward to watch you walk away from me only because I don't have the courage &amp; be brave enough to hold you in my life.
Undeniably, whenever I see you or talk to you, I just can't stop my smile and laugh. I just knew you're the only one who can light me up.
RT : I remember how we started talking.
Set your goals high, and don't stop until you get there.

Stay away from me mindless dregs !!!!!
When you're single, all you see are happy couples. When you're taken, all you see are happy singles.
I wonder if I ever across your mind.
When a girl is in love, you can see it in her smile. When a boy is in love, you can see it in his eyes !
Attempting to convince yourself that you don't care about someone is a clear indicator that you really do.
Ironically, the people who ignore you now, will somehow need you later.

原來，太認真就輸了！
What you expect to happen is a big part of what the result will be. Think positive.
We all have that one person that we'll always have feelings for, no matter what. Just one look, &amp; it takes you right back to those memories
Sometimes there is no next time, no second chance, no time out. Sometimes it is now or never.
So much to say, so much to ask.
I'm thinking about you all day long. Your shadow, your face and everything have show up in my mind. To be frank, I miss you so.
It's unbelievable how fast people can change. One day, you mean everything. The next day, you don't exist anymore
RT : It's unbelievable how fast people can change. One day, you mean everything. The next day, you don't exist anymore.
