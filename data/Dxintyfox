一个人,让爱重生
我想留的留不住了, 这一次决定放手了.
RT : 你应该爱的，是一个不管怎样都不会放弃你的人。
RT : 前面的路还很远，你可能会哭，但是一定要走下去，2014年，一定不能停。
RT : 当你全心全意为一个人付出时，这人往往会背叛你。因为你已经全然付出，而毫无新鲜感和利用价值。人性是极可恶的东西，它对得到的往往不珍惜。所以，当你被人伤害，首先想想，是不是自己付出的太多，把自己放低了。想要别人疼惜你，首先要自己疼自己。高贵的…
RT : 别等不该等的人，别伤不该伤的心。有些人，注定是生命中的过客；有些事，常常让我们很无奈。爱情、友情。看得淡一点，伤就会少一点。
RT : 时间，让深的东西越来越深，让浅的东西越来越浅。看的淡一点，伤的就会少一点，时间过了，爱情淡了，也就散了。我们真的要过了很久很久，才能够明白，自己真正怀念的，到底是怎样的人，怎样的事。
RT : 我们缺乏安全感，缺乏自信心，所以我们假装快乐，假装合群，假装大笑，只是为了迎合别人。其实在心底，我们比谁都寂寞，孤单。
RT : 其实，我过的一点都不好。
RT : 最好的朋友，平时互相调侃，是嘴最狠的那个。在你需要的时候，却是心最软的那个。
": 不要因为努力的变成别人喜欢的样子，却到头来连自己都忘了真实的自己。"
RT : 最好的朋友，就是当所有人都觉得我小题大做的时候，她懂得我为什么哭得如此歇斯里底。
女孩最怕的就是感情没像从前那么好
RT : Age 4: "I love Mommy."
Age 16: "I HATE HER."
Age 20: "Mom was right"
Age 57: "I wish my Mom was still here."

Retweet if …

RT : ": so true 👏👏 " this..
RT  太多心里话
RT  每个人都在变。如果你不逼迫自己成长，就只能接受被这世界残忍以待
RT : 心累，就是常常徘徊在坚持和放弃之间，举棋不定。烦恼，就是记性太好，该记的，不该记的都会留在记忆里。
RT : 总要经历一些背叛一些心酸，才能把人心看明白。
RT : 人生最痛苦的不是要什么得不到，而是根本不知道自己要什么。
RT : 我以为，真心对人，也可以换来别人真心对待。拼了命的不让身边的人难过，却发现，受伤的原来是我自己。
RT : 花一些时间，总会看清一些事。用一些事情，总会看清一些人。
RT : 人生的苦难并不可怕，可怕的是就此失去希望。
RT : 你们有没有过这种感觉，知道了真相以后，觉得当初的自己特别的傻特别的蠢。发现原来一直以来自己都像个小丑一样被人看笑话，可是自己却毫不知情。真可笑，真可悲…
RT : 随着年龄的增长，我们并不是失去了一些朋友，而是我们懂得了谁才是真正的朋友。
RT : I’ve lost my discipline, I need to get back on track.
RT : Am at my worst now, this is what i get!
 yes, you may. Lai, gong!
RT :  and also Gina can I ask you a question????
 your english best sia. Baik sia
 this one too direct plus cui lo pls dumbo. Hahahahha
RT :  有些人表面对你很好，但是其实他/她只是在演戏给你看，因为他/她想利用你或要你帮忙,不然就是没有人要陪他。（this better then yours)
 你就是一个例子了吗,还需要懂的meh.鸟人!
RT :  我听过美人鱼，但是我还没有听过鸟人
 因为我不要写的太好吗,不然别人读不懂啦! 什么狗?叫你妈妈是吗?
不是每个人表面上跟你很要好就是你的朋友,鸟人!
 妈的。至少我也有拿到A华文ok!!
RT :  你需不需要我帮你补习你的华语？😂
Daddy's happy hour at home again! Karaoke♡ Sissy being extra😂

可怕也可悲,虚假的混球
No point being upset over this, just take it as you're all DEAD. Don't bother, life would be better.
Don't bother, life would be better.
