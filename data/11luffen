RT : Morning! Guess who's at the studio preparing for her new drama 'Against the Tide'? Stay tuned for more updates! http://t.co/…
More excited for against the tide imaging today!
I'm really not thrilled about the idea if the cast remains the same, I don't really wanna see her in a drama with En again.

Zoe's role a bit flat, nothing to 发挥, but she should have gotten in instead of rebecca, and Joanne should have gotten in instead of chris
Did they just decided to leave out and pretend sudden didn't happen? I almost slept watching clif2 but it got nominated instead

Fine, since the chances are not high, I don't have to be so nervous on that day like last year.
If Siqi in With You can get a BA, I don't see why Chu Ning can't get at least a nomination -.-
Whatever, at least the one ch 8 mentioned was not her. Chu Ning is still my BA. Yah, but CLP should get it.
Obviously she has a better chance with Sudden, comedic roles rarely win...
But come on lah, how can chu ning not be in it, I rather chu ning get in rather than tong lin
Oh Thank God!
RT : Congrats to Rui En's nomination! RT : [最新] 《红星大奖2014》公布完整入围名单，重头剧《志在四方》风光入围15项，陈莉萍、欧萱、瑞恩齐抢夺“视后”！更多：http://t.co/td2QpnFs…
And there's no way JP in tang shan can win RE in sudden, unless you're blind. Ok, good night.
Anyway I hope they don't deny CLP of a worthy nomination again. In fact she should win this year's BA.
But JP is a mdc artiste and is in a year end blockbuster, so...😒
I think JP is more of a 常客 than RE. She only started getting nominated in from 11, JP started in 07
Wonder if hints will be given like last year a not...
