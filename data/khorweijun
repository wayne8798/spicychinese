 要快乐, 嗯？😊😊💕💞
RT : 最温馨的事, 是好久不见的朋友捎来一封真诚的祝福。最单纯的友谊, 是不需要太多言语, 一个眼神, 一个微笑, 也能暖入心坎 :) ♥

生活有时会很艰难，好像所有的付出都没的回报，好似所有的努力都白费，生气，懊恼，焦虑等心情笼罩自己，但是真的，只要相信，只要不放弃，所有的付出和努力会开花结果。真的真的。
Hot chocolate &gt; coffee. 
 all your exercise and healthy eating will balance it out! Hehe. Though it's just the first month, enjoy yrself ttm! 😄😄
Super excited for CNY! (Squeals) This year's gonna be extra special- just for a day, but still... ahhhh!!! 😊😊😊✌✌✌
New year has never been about the food or Angpaus or fireworks to me. The family gathering is what I look forward to most!
 hahahaha oh sister, for someone who's sleep deprived, you surely look good! ;)
 happy birthday Rachel! Enjoy your big day and all the best to you!
 you'd be the cutest one!
I am thankful for friends who stick with me through hardships. Sometimes when you fall, you see who picks you up- that's a wonderful thing.
Heading to college early to discuss points with the teammates with a bag full of determination &amp; good luck wishes from the friends. :)

So tired. Debate tomorrow. I will (must) pull through this...!!!
New intakes + new year shoppers = craaaaazy traffic.
我喜欢抱着乐观积极态度的人，我喜欢和朋友相处开心的时段，我喜欢人们善良的心，我喜欢美丽的世界，我喜欢生活的每一天都有值得奋斗，期待的事情。：）
人生好多事情是让我很害怕很恐惧的，譬如在很多人面前演说，那是好生疏的事，毕竟有一段日子脱离演讲。。。但是只有踏出第一步，才是活着的意义不是吗？我比任何人讨厌丢脸，但那不是不尝试的借口，所以决定勇敢一次。加油，惠钧。😊
 hence you blog about cakes... And beyond... Haha (blog promotion) 🙈🙈🙈
 good luck!!! 👍👍👍❤❤❤
 hang in there Jeanne! Maths is crazy but then you will eventually get hold of it. Show maths who's boss!!!
 over here? Where are you now? 😁😁😁
Is it okay to be in CNY mood already? #rubshandsinglee 😊😊😊
A year since I set foot in Sunway university again. #memories
人容易抱怨，爱比较，总觉得自己拥有的不够多。抱怨而不做出改变只是在原地踏步，不懂得珍惜拥有，永远不会知足，快乐。我承认自己也会有怨天尤人的时候，但那让自己很累，我时刻提醒自己要用一颗感恩的心看世界，必然发现，世界其实好美。人生短暂，珍惜拥有，活出自己。
 ahh no worries there's no way mistaking you :) It's in HOT magazine! So proud to have a fashionista friend! :)
 Minnieeee!! I hv no idea how this girl named Marina looks exactly like you, but damn she's pretty! ;)

@EvengelinMay hahaha I'm just seriously impressed you can play so many instruments at once. So yes, fondue aside, you're real dedicated!
 我也许不能完全体会你的感受，但我想告诉你，你很棒，也很善良，这样内外都一样美的女孩，一定会找到快乐的。记得微笑！
 feeling your happiness 😉 rest well Chermaine! ❤
 haha that makes two of us :) yup, we'll prob see each other next year jan 7th! ;) enjoy your holidays!
我很害怕，最亲的朋友莫名奇妙地对我冷淡。我想知道，是粗心大意的我不小心得罪了他吗？是我直爽不经大脑思考说话的方式伤害了他吗？怎么办。。。
 hope you feel better soon may Yean!
Yes. 
 I had them since Tuesday! I blame it on post exams aversion... Hahaha. Enjoy indulging &amp; blogging about the delicacies!
 not weird at all! I approve. Your solution: chocolate crepe. 🍫🍫🍫✌✌✌
This. 
If you're upset, down, or disappointed, remember, things are about to get really good. 💛😊
 didn't know u couldn't handle spicy food! Hehe. Are you on a vacation now?
Let's make the best out of December. 🎅 Here's to gingerbread men, Xmas trees 🎄, jingle bells, presents exchange 🎁, love &amp; faith. 🌟
 positive thinking, indeed, jay Ching. Have a great Saturday!
Should be revising A2 but I suppose sometimes being rational takes away all the fun! 😚
Exercising has a way of turning your mood from blah to oh yeah. 💪👍
Pleasant weather on a beautiful Saturday! 🌸🍁🌳 Swam earlier this morning. Brrr pool water was cold. ❄❄❄
 I like your thinking. We'll eat fortune cookies while discussing about kpop (for yr sake) &amp; tackle the Great Wall of china!!
 still that's a good news bcos we get to go to Korea together in the future, right? :D you'll be my best translator!
 I know u'd kill me when you read this but my mum decided we're trading in cold, snowy Korea for warm, sunny Australia...
 in my defence, I just got to know it yesterday. :D besides, I can take plenty of pics and send them to you! ^^v good idea?
 #modelstudentindeed #tokohwawasan we all have those days.... Not judging!
 ❤❤❤💞💞💞 am actually going to Korea for vacation. Thinking to pack u in my luggage! 😁
 :D :D :D Love your determination!

 哈哈我们好久没用华语沟通了！感觉很棒！你把话说得很好，我赞同，真的。只有自己看透事情，才帮得到自己。谢谢你，保重，愿我们很快再见！
 你是我非常喜欢的学妹，羡慕你的高度更欣赏你的真挚和认真。认识你我是很开心，希望你快乐常在，要记住你很棒！
 I love when your cheery, beautiful smile greets me 😊 stay happy and pretty, too, you!
 hehehe my friend from coll loves Exo as well so I can deal with the fan girl moments. :D i know, it's been almost a year!!!
 I love her too! ESP after watching dear johns! She can sing and act so well!
 ah my bad I forgot about the emoji! Hehe of course anytime you like! I will be praying for your exam to go smoothly!
我对于思想负面的自己产生强烈的憎恨，我觉得，快乐这两个字，好像很遥远，仿佛好久都没真正地快乐过。妈常劝我忽想太多，享受眼前的幸福和快乐。朋友说我傻，因为表面上我看似没什么好担心。我总觉得压力是我自己施于自己的，脑没有一刻宁静，这感觉无比地痛苦。
 Jia you! 💪💪💪 I'm sure you can do it! 😁 Will be over before you realise!
 😊😊😊😊 多笑啦，你微笑很好看。❤
 mmhmm my dear alin... Might that person be a Korean star from super junior? 😏😏😏
 I feel you! It's been a while since we learn for long hours, need some getting use to! Take care &amp; rest well, my dear!
 nope. i think yrs may take just a while more. Fret not Chermaine, it's a painful wait but the acceptance letters will come! :)
 when did you send in yours? :)
 I feel u! Went through the whole process &amp; nearly went mad. U get it done &amp; u will feel so relieved. Hang in there!
 aiyer can't get over the show ah? :p
 okay please make an extra! I like apples and beetroot and celery and a pinch of ginger! Kidding sis, kidding. Enjoy your drink!
"It's not happy people who are thankful, it's thankful people who are happy." Cliche, but I believe in it.

 sadly I am tied to window shopping :p well you could consider posting some good finds on the blog too! ;)
I'd like to live in a country where berries 🍓 and nuts 🍠 and clothes 👗👚🎽 aren't so expensive! 💰
 you're very kind, jay Ching. I appreciate yr comment &amp; I'd like to think we BOTH could do smtg to make this world a better place.
Went out for a walk &amp; got chased back home by the sudden pouring rain. Why rain why. Talk about embarrassing TT

@yvette_jd gah post the pic aite? Lemme drool a bit. ;)
 it's tough, but you'll pull through with all the exercises you do, Rachel :)
 ah mums are always the best! Have fun!
I think part of the reason why we hold onto something so tight is because we fear something that great won't happen twice.
Fall in love with yourself because someday you're gonna be the only person you've got.
I'm one of those who gets mad anxious when I've many things awaiting me to be completed. I also tend to procrastinate a lot. Oh the irony.
 I feel u! Stretch as much as you can once u arrive!
RT : 
RT : Catching Fire's posters everywhere, sooooo excited!!!
 haha I should learn from you! Less on twitter and more focus on studies :)

Am I the only one who gets excited about Christmas already? *squeal in delight
RT :  pain is temporary, pride is forever 😤👌

How am I so lucky to have such a wonderful people around me. I ought to count my blessings more often bcos it makes me happy. 😊
Hanging out with friends has got to be my best stress reliever. And one of my fav thing to do.
Thankful for friends who are incredibly wonderful, hilarious &amp; made today so enjoyable.    
Not sure why I even tried.
RT : its only 810? feels like 11 already

Started the day off on the right foot. No pun intended.
 so it was SAM sitting for the paper at 7am? I was really curious about the timing! So impressive y'all went thru it!
that restless feeling... been surviving on minimal sleep for days. So tired but I can't sleep bcos my mind refuses to rest.
 and dangerous! What can I say? My friend here has mad courage (and skills) ;)
Pounding headache after swim at night. Always the most significant indicator that I'm frightfully sleep deprived.
 will do so every year! 👍
I forget to reply ppl a lot bcos I have a tendency to mentally reply their messages.

Life as a college student.
