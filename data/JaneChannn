morning ! (;
": 喜欢一个人，就是在一起很开心。爱一个人，就是即使不开心，也想在一起。"
": 吵不散，骂不走，那才叫爱情。 只要结局是跟你在一起，过程让我怎么痛都行。"
": 你之所以感到孤独，并不是没有人关心你，而是你在乎的那个人没有关心你。"
": 过去的，别再遗憾；未来的，无须忧虑；现在的，加倍珍惜。"
": 认识一个人靠缘分，了解一个人靠耐心，征服一个人靠智慧，和睦相处靠包容。" ♥
": 时不时看看手机，是很期待你突如其来的关心。"
永远都不要抱怨什么，抱怨只会暴露你的无能。。。 
": 有些痛，忍忍就过了，有些麻烦，忍忍就解决了，有些话，忍忍就不想说了，有些爱，忍忍就不想爱了，有些人，忍忍就不想等了。"
Morning peeps!
身边的人那么多，懂自己的有几个。不要对我说,我是个好人，我很可爱，我很活泼。我只是个，会自卑，会伤心，会小心眼的普通人。其实，我很好，只是不习惯，只是会偶尔难受一下，只是会在某一瞬间突然很想某个人，只是会在听到某一句熟悉的话时很难过。。。
Chatting with my babe  like, every night. Just like those sweet couples. Lol. Haha. ♥😘
Just finished my shower. I'd broke my record! 😓

复杂的事情简单做，你就是专家；
简单的事情重复做，你就是行家；
重复的事情用心做，你就是赢家...
