RT : 如果一个女孩，在这样寒冷的冬天，仍然坚持每天按时起床，不迟到不请假。手冻僵了只在心里默默抱怨，用嘴呵两口气又能生龙活虎。脚冻麻了也不撒娇，只是跺跺脚复又笑靥如花。她的明媚温暖了寒冬，她的微笑是最动人的画面。这样的女孩……她一定没有男朋友。

Clubs develop players under COE &amp; good ones end up with CYL. So what's the point? Clubs might as well focus on Professional level.

 Organizations seldom acquire wisdom. they move based on vision
  The donuts etc, while not impactful from fans point of view. It is a good start for Corporate involvement.
