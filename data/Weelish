RT : when someone tells you about your drunken actions the night before: 
If you can dream it, you can do it.
Haiya damn lazy to go rehab
Memories of you coming back
我愿意🙋
A bottle of liquor Is the best now
RT : Sometimes i just don't want to even think about it.
Why do things turn out to be like this
I'm a left handed but now my left hand is as good as useless. Tell me how? Huhhh what should I do now
If someone is not with you during your worst then they don't deserve to be here during your best
Feelings like this will go away one day
It's a painful thing to love someone who loves another
Feel so happy for you bro
人生中会有些阶段超越你的想像。只剩下意念还在防抗提醒这我坚定不投降模糊的视线照旧模糊方向已经撑不住还要装着坚强。选择那一条路还可以用什么创造路转走了一大段又来到一个湾很确定绝不回头再也不管最后怎样雨再大风在狂希望再渺茫我知道有个人一定在我的身旁陪伴。希望我那个人会出现。

So tired
at the end of the day it's still about yourself, the choices you have made.
I'm at Northpoint Shopping Centre (Singapore) w/ 3 others

Life sucks when you have a selfish ass hole at home
良心发现

Boring
Hang in there.
Is it so hard to let go that 1 month?
Procrastinating

No matter what you say, nothing can stop me now
I just ate 1 hour plus ago now I'm hungry 😒
Two things defined you. Your patience when you have nothing. And your attitude when you have everything.
 black like normal only
因为她的出现而破坏了我的所有。那我又能怎样？难道她一点也不内疚？黑漆漆的日子几时才雨过天晴？

 I remember! 😁🙋

I'm at People's Park Complex (Singapore) 
You told me time will prove everything. My ass
你最终想要打败的也不过是你自己
These few days I slept while hiding in my blanket keeling lost and hopeless
I'm so stress up. Thoughts of giving up flooding me
Back for rehab lala (@ TTSH Rehab Centre) 
When I saw those photos I turn emotional
I'm at Hougang Mall (Singapore)

I'm at Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery (光明山普觉禅寺 Bright Hill Temple) (Singapore) 
I'm at Sri Lankaramaya Buddhist Temple (Sleeping Buddha) 
No matter how much you change, you still got to pay the price for the things you've done.

Please be careful tomorrow and may you have a safe trip :)
Happy Chinese New Year Friends! 😊and to you too! 心马🐎年快乐。身体健康！take care of your self tomorrow.
Why is it so difficult to forget you
And the cold wind blows
既然她都不在乎了那还念念不忘干嘛？
Even the sweetest guy will turn into a total bastard once his heart is broken by the girl he love
Reunion (@ Gim Tim Restaurant(锦珍) w/ 2 others) 
I'm at The Grassroots' Club (Singapore) 
You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
以前被对待的不好不代表别人也会做一样的事。太不公平了
I hate Chinese New Year because got nice movies but I can't go 😡
RT : The Lion King 
 nothing bro don't worry you going remy house?
有些人不知道什么是领情
You know I want you to be happy. And more than anything, I wanted to be the cause of happiness in you.
原来我在你心中一点地位一点值得你留念de也没有比不上他
既然我不值得你回头也不值得你留念那算了我知道我配不上你我没用连走也不可以
真的不值得你留念不值得你回头？
难道做错事了就真的不能再有机会改吗？
真的有那么令你讨厌吗
I screw up my CNY
难道真的没希望了？
I pluck out the courage and tell her what I want to say
I want to contact you but I don't have the courage to do so
你给我听着不管发生什么事不管你在哪里我会等你我会找到你
流眼泪了。现在最需要的就是一个肩膀。但是我一无所有。知错能改是真的吗？谈恋爱太可怕了一下下就会让你觉得一切绝望了。
我不会忘记你对我的好。我真的真的很难过。多么希望可以从心再来多一次。会好好珍惜你。对不起我是个出差经的人让你失望。
RT : "Women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved." (Hitchcock)
为什么就是感动不了你
Dear god must you really be so cruel

不要太抬杠自己做人要谦虚
And my therapist gave me 2 books for presents! See where to find these kind of people. 绝种了:')
风水轮流转
Because all these while I'm actually testing  people only and not my actual personality. Sadly to say some of them failed.
This is why I never put in 100% because till now no one deserve my 100%
Salehmalehkum! 😁

Please don't waste my time this time round (@ TTSH NNI Neurodiagnoatic) 
: 我是不会放弃追求我的梦想。总有一天你会看到我是认真的。今天失败那明天，明天失败再后天一直试
既然做了这个决定我就绝不后悔我不会让你失望。
长大了才了解他们的意思。为什么要有这样狼狈的心
阿嬷我后悔了为什么不要听你的话，到头来吃亏的是自己受伤害的也是自己。从小你对我最好总是把最好的留给我。时间一分一秒得过去我真的是无能为力一直想到她。我一直在叫她他有没有听到。有机会的话下半辈子我还是会做这个选择。
I'm at TTSH Rehab Centre 
肿了我是不是很傻？ 
Feeling so helpless
Back to square one
船到桥头自然直
Almost went into #hungerstrike haven't eaten for 2 days and finally ate something 😣
So true!
烂桃花一大堆
以后做什么事都要三思而后行
Waiting for time to pass
Whoever wants to see my downfall congrats you did it, you people can throw a party now. All I do now everyday is staring in the open space
你都不再了。我也不需要再那么坚强。我彻底地放弃
就不能给我一场轰轰烈烈的爱吗
要怎样才可以不用那么痛苦
现在的我已经弄丢了指南针，迷失了方向
Wo我真的愿意用我的命来换取你
Sorry I can't take it anymore I need to sleep haven't been resting for more than 24 hours. Good night hope I will never wake up
I don't bother anymore really I've nothing to look forward nothing to keep me pushing on. Whoever want my life come and take it I give you.
If I can turn back the time 我还是会选择无条件地为你付出。
给我一杯忘情水
到现在我还不知道自己做错了什么
I'm dying haven't slept for past 24 hours
其实我如果要害你我是很容易的但是我不要因为我自己还有良心！
Still cannot control myself
CB I still feel like I'm a bloody fool to actually believe you
You were right. I've gotten my retribution and I accept it
我们的爱我明白已变成你的负担只是永远我都放不开最后的温暖
I love disappointment because it makes me roar even louder! I'm won't bother to take revenge. 人在做天在看！
真的是心太软把所有问题都自己扛
If only I can turn back the time I definitely won't chops to walk this path
离开你是我傻我错
吃不能吃睡不能睡，没有了你全都不对。人不像人鬼不像鬼很难呼吸。能不能不爱了因为爱太痛了我痛得快死了却无法把你忘了。
现在什么也不想了。只想好好把伤养好然后今年年尾去读书，读个成绩出来。找个好工作过平平凡凡的生活就够了
只能怪自己太天真打从一开始就是个错误
Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you.
After all it's just my assumption
