好失望 ，原来你最亲最爱最重视的人才是那个有本事伤你最深的人。
We wished that we were good enough to be noticed. We wished that one day, we will mean something to that someone who meant the world to us.
The reason why I look forward to coming home everyday. ♥ #bestmumonearth

Sometimes, it's not about if you want it or not. We cant control everything and anything. We are just humans. We don't always have a choice.
Squeezing in the train early in the morning had became a routine.

Internet connection sucks big time in the morning. If we are paying a relatively high amt of $$ for it, shouldn't we deserve better service?
开工咯
Currently working on my blog but yea it've been years ever since i last edited HTML &amp; i suck @ that now! Any experts willing to help me out?
Sorry but i kinda look down on girls who get close to a guy just for benefits (money/fame/etc) You look cheap &amp; you've given up your pride.
Christmas chocolate given by my bnj manager lynn! super love &lt;3 #Throwback . 
I like mature guys. Guys who act like a gentleman. Guys who have a matured mindset.
" 好聚好散 " 对不起 ，我做不到。
 of course. Hahaha you're already sixteen so shouldn't be a problem. If not you wait till tml when I go to work I check for you.
 you can go over to any dbs /posb branch to change your card limit. Just bring along your nric and your card.
Finally. I survived. Working from 6am-11pm is helllllllll.  (Although there is like 4hrs break in between but still it's hell )
two. Rt ":  wah. How many jobs you having?"
Ended work at raffles &gt; shopping at bugis &gt; starting work again at nightsafari. x.x 加油加油！
Woke up at 6am again on a Saturday for work. Bloody tired. #Moneyisthemotivation
Goodnight. Gotta be a super long and tiring day for me tml. Working like mad. Bless me. 
So many things took place   within this short week. I got my results, I work like mad, I was happy, I… 
  we're 好buddies for 5years already!
Waiting for  to knock off and meet me for dinner! x.x

No preference , let fate decide. Rt ":  hahahaha so which poly u aiming for?"

 ya. Haiya forget it. Not like my scores very lousy. Just one subject ruined it. Others are friendly. Just waiting for ans lor..

 the people there quite rude. Idk. Wasn't helpful at all . Wasted trip.
hahaha damn!! RT ": early morning 9am this @febbyleejq 肥比李 called me ask if JAE form need to print. I thought it was a dream lol."

Gotta be another hectic and depressing day for me. Running 4 polytechnics today to appeal for my desired course. Hope that I can get it!!
rt ": This saddens me somehow :/ "
This is what hardwork paid me with. Shouldnt have given out my all in the first place. I dont give in my best for bullshits in return do i?
After work, have to worry and crack my head about which courses to choose and which to appeal first. This is so disheartening. Im so tired.
Anyone studying in tp now? can do me a favour?
 hais.. that's why I very sad. Thanks luh you too!
 I'll try... thanks alot x.
就因为有努力所以才伤心。就因为有付出，所以才要求收回。RT ":  你知道你已经努力了。不要那么党心了。"
 thanks 小花 ♥
What have I got to say? I did work hard. I did gave in my best. Sometimes, I don't know if life is kidding me or am I kidding myself.
 my results is not bad. But that is the only flaw that like literally destroyed everything.
I fucking hate the bell curve. I just can't get over it. It's so wasted.
Still have to work tml despite having a heavy heart. Get over it? yea why not stand in my shoes and see if it's as easy as said.
thanks taozi. ":  its all over!! life goes on...so jiayou chio move on!!!"
It's just so disheartening.
thanks sist. Work hard for os this year. ":  All the best for whatever course or school you are going!!!"

But well looking on the bright side, I can finally say "goodbye woodlands sec, goodbye secondary school life".
So this is what hardwork pays me. Great. Ha.

Yesterday night was hell to me. Feels like I just reached the gates of hell and got saved back once again. That feeling is indescribable.
事实早已摆在眼前 ，是我始终不想接受 ，选择避开 。最后伤得最深的是我自己 ，能怪的也只有我自己 。
