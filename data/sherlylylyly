so yeahhh. i'm also skipping lunch so that i could eat more later at night!!! #fatfatdieme. have a warm cny reunion dinner with ur fam guys!
buttttt. i'm not fully ready to be bombarded with the same questions again and again  i'll def get married (of cos, after my sis).
reunion dinner is the time when u get to meet all ur relatives. aunties, uncles, nephews, cousins, etc.. can't wait for tonite's dinner!

 不可能啦，他们一定在生气的时候随便乱说而已。人家正在生气时所骂／说过的话不要放在心上。。 我想我可以理解你现在的感受。been there sih. good luck!  要幸福！
 不管我们有多大，在他们眼里，我们永远是他们的心肝宝贝， daddy's n mommy's little girl. 这一点你也应该知道。anyways, 如果你连试都没有，就已经要放弃的话，那太可惜了吧？给他一个机会，也给彼此一个机会。
 要勇敢地追求你的幸福&amp;梦想！现在最重要的就是 只要等到好时机。the courage is already there。加油啦！千万别跟你父母说谎，要不然他们一定会更不允许你们在一起。

 你哥哥和姐姐也不可能一直管你感情上的事吧！just need to convince ur mom n dad la. sry with all these chinese words ah. lebi enak aja jd pendek tweetny
 但是你也不要怪你爸妈。他们这么做也有他们的理由。i mean.. pasti mreka sedikit lebih 怕他们宠爱的女儿吃苦。我爸也这样坦白跟我说过。
 nope. dont go backstreet. tell em straight to their face, and in a nice way. dont ever raise ur voice.. just keep calm.
 跟你爸妈说，你对这个男孩有信心。反正你还年轻嘛！还不到 25. tell em to give u time to prove then wrong. 你爸妈的想法完全跟我爸妈一样！！！
 willing to work+strong financial buat apa if u dont love him. ya kan. they cant force u to marry someone u dont love.
 they dont want to see u hurt. but kan u can tell em, ini cm pas pacaran ldr. as long as u make sure pas married gak ldr lagi.
 it's normal that ur parents are afraid. mine too. they want e best for their daughter u see. ldr = in e end pasti ada aja probs.
 uang itu bisa dicari. asal orangnya willing to work. mesti ada tujuan di dalem hidup. as for ldr, i personally think that...
 besides, not all rich guys are good u see. AND not all of them bisa cari duit. banyakan kan just spend their money like water
 money status def isn't a problem. as long as ur guy isn't a lazy bum who just spends his days doing nothing but playing games.
 i've been in ur situation once. i know how u feel. but hey, at least i tried! haha.
 但你也还没试试看啊。if u think he's the best for u, then i think 你应该要加倍努力让你父母亲看你的选择是对的。u'll never know if u never try
 我个人觉得你应该去追求你的幸福。。 不要管别人怎样看你，用你自己的眼光去看这个世界。你的心，你自己最了解。
感谢主让我们全家可以很平安和快乐， 也感谢您给我一个溫暖的家  晚安咯！
