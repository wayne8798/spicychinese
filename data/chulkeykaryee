不要怪别人听不到你说什么 因为你说话的声音小到根本不像在说话

RT : ＂她分手後完全不會像其他座在人面前要死要活，她嬉笑怒鬧，變得更加開朗。在聽到朋友說有關他的話題時，從不刻意迴避，她適當參與，淡然微笑，她的表現總會遭人懷疑這段感情的深淺，而人群中只有那些知道背後情節的人才看見她背後的眼淚和努力。＂

RT : 不要和自私的人做朋友，因为呢，他从头到尾只照顾自己，不理会别人的死活。也不要和喜欢拍马屁的人做朋友，因为这种人，喜欢看风驶舵。你好的时候就靠拢，你不好的时候，就离开。何必浪费时间，跟这种人在一起。
I swear I will cry out if I got a chance to hug nick vujicic.

RT : 当你在最困难的时候，你会看到很多朋友离去，不要伤心，因为那是你终于看清楚他们真面目的时候。所以，你为什么要伤心原形毕露的安排？
With ma loves 😚 
RT : Remember, people who fall the hardest bounce back the highest when God is involved.
