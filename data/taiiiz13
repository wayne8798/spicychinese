If mandarin oranges/apples doesn't work out tomorrow, maybe can try using Watermelon instead? Hahahaha #chapgohmei #ValentinesDay
Don't throw into the river , straight throw to the person's house more effective. Throw into river will create pollution larr. #chapgohmei

Was a great movie overall despite some disgusting scenes. Salute to America's Army Soldiers!
Bloods, shooting scenes, falling from the upper hill to lower hill that was full of stones, etc etc.
Yesterday's Lone Survivor scenes still on my mind. 😱
Good morning!
Happy Birthday Bee!  All ze best in whatever you do an have a blast ;)
 maybe sim card problem. Got line coverage mou?
Respect other people from different country lar at least. Really felt so ashamed being a Malaysian.
And the crowd too, the stadium was so noisy throughout the whole match.
They won but I didn't feel proud, and instead I felt ashamed of their attitude throughout the match.
Goh V Shen and Lim Khim Wah won the final match of Mens Double Malaysia Open. Keep seducing the crowd and opponent throughout the match.
Such a boring Sunday.

世界上最悲哀的事情是，你深深的恋上一个人，但心里却清楚得很，她不可能给你同样的回应。
任何打击都不应该成为你堕落的借口，你改变不了这个世界，但你可以改变自己，选择一条正确的路，坚定的走下去。晚安 #fb
