Eat those foods that I wanted to try for so long, going back to the places where I found delicious foods

One day 
All the happiness that we used to enjoy turned into nightmares that scared us the most in the end.
For you, I'm not hot chic like 'em, I don't have attitude to play with, I don't have tons of friends for you to playing fool with.
I don't know about anything but if you're still stalking, you can pretty save up your time for another girl.
Cause all the old story doesn't matter anymore when you get disappointed of who they've become.
At least we can have a better sad story than the previous one.
If I'm going to your passenger one day, please fetch me to a nicer place, let's take more decent photos of us.

RT :  you don't wake up every morning to satisfy every single people...do what you like and do what you want , surf above …
This year is just all about failure of mine.
There's nothing I can do well, even you wanted me to do so, to let you go.
我以為我的溫柔  能夠給你整個宇宙
我以為我能全力填滿你感情的缺口
專心陪在你左右  彌補她一切的錯
也許我太過天真  以為奇蹟會發生
Some lyrics are just too good to just write in words.
