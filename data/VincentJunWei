我们需不需要那么的有默契？
我不找你；你也不找我？
Do you want to see the weakest form of me?
I'm also vulnerable, fragile and insecure.
I also need your love...and embrace
我们都傻，傻在宁愿被牺牲也不愿放弃天真；还在期待会有奇迹出现。 Feeling, missing you.
In the middle of dinner. I stopped suddenly. I think of you. I lost my appetite. I miss you. ...
Wish that you were with me.
你如果问我爱你有多深。
你望向那无边的海洋，便是我的答案。
I wanna shelter you.
臭小孩，害我浪费了30块。
也幸好你取消了熬夜。
I take back my words.
I think I dont like you anymore.
I think I love you.
Your words pushed me to work even harder. There is something that I must complete before I die. Revolution must come. God, pls lead me.
世界上最遥远的距离并不是生与死，而是我就站在你面前，你却不知道我爱你。
胆小鬼！
站在人家门前却不敢进去！
Finally got his number and have a great chat. He is really cute.
Sorry, I aim for a revolution, not a petition.
如果人生能像连续剧，多一集让我们排演，或许我们能成为更相信爱情的人。不是不信，只是爱情…是个泥沼，一旦深陷，便不可自拔。
拜托不要现在告诉我…请让我继续喜欢你。
如果他不是同类，那我的答案，根本就没有意义。
The days when I live with my freedom, and walk the path I want. They WILL come true.
到头来还是一个人躺着发呆、一个人醒来；你从未存在。
Hope what I dreamt was not true. I just cant take it. Not a single bit.
I just saw someone who looks like me in my friend's photo. It is so rare and dumb to admit it. He somehow looks like me. I just cant tell.
Before you echo Amen in your home or place of worship, think and remember. A child is listening.
Im afraid of rejection, very afraid.
一大清早想起好久以前听过的一首歌，孙楠-留什么给你。爱都是开始的很美丽、结束的没道理，想想是很可惜。从以前的为赋新词强说愁，才发现岁月让我更能体悟到感情的精髓。爱恨情愁，何尝不是人生必经之道？
I wish I didnt fool myself again. Wish everything goes well. I miss you.
你知不知道其实这样很辛苦？
每次喜欢一个人，然后又要残忍的把自己薄弱的，卑微的愿望给亲手抹杀。
感觉就像一个胎死腹中的母亲，软弱无力的哭泣和嚎叫，却没有一把理解的声音。
有时候天真的很残忍。
如果这个世界不允许我存在，那就从来不应该有我。
爱情对我来说，就像奢侈的幸福。在自己的心里开始出现的感觉，从来不被允许重视；却必须残忍的拔除。因为，我们没有恋爱的权利和资格。我只希望有一天等我变得强大的时候，能够让和我一样的人，拥有恋爱的权利。穷则独善其身，达则兼善天下。再一次的坚定了自己的意图。千里之行，始于足下。
不知道你有没有花过一秒在想着一个人呢？
我们会不会也有这样的结局？ 
I knew there is always a reason for someone to walks into your life. My mission was to make a revolution. Will you come with me?
What are you doing? 
Wonder how is he doing?
He has been missing one whole day.
What happened?
This guy is so rude. Keep wanna peep into my phone, and be jealous about everything. Kiasu to the max!
Never this stress before.
Collapse soon.
Notes重到我胸肌都开始有了！
He is just so nice. I cant stop myself from smiling when I just think of him. Woke up in 8am just to wish me luck for exam. You are so sweet
希望已经是对的时候，遇上一个对的人。
实话说，不是爱不起，只是伤不起。
I just cant forget your eyes, they are so beautiful!!!
他真的很好看。Such a nice and pleasant day!
这算什么？
卑微得连爱上一个人的资格都没有。
没有。
反正也从来没拥有过。
没拥有过，又能怎样失去？
那是个不属于你的世界、你到不了的天堂。
He is really amazing. AMAZING.
Wish that I can know him more and he dont mind!
有时候很讨厌自己，就是喜欢把事情都收在心底，不说出来。
有时候，不管你怎么做，好像都没有对的选择。就算喜欢，也不能追你。
我们都害怕尝试；我们爱不起、伤不起。当机会靠近的时候，就努力的避开，当作自己什么都没感觉到；逃避着不知名的恐惧，和假想敌的心碎。把自己沉浸在一遍一遍的音乐里，告诉自己不能轻易堕入。因为，我们爱不起，也伤不起。
OMG many Daniel are cute guy, I gotta admit
😳惊天动地的消息！
I need more openness. I need more, more, more!
不知道该用什么身份来和他说话？
我感觉不到任何东西。
只是看着，看着。
如果他是个狂妄的人，我倔强的脾气会出来。
真讨厌自己的真性情。
他们不会明白那种感受。寂寞、孤独、隐藏、社会的歧视、无止尽的痛苦。他们以为自己能感受那份痛。但那只好比天上的一朵云，对比那广阔的天空，是一种无法想像的撕心裂肺。
有时候，我也好希望自己像别人一样，是个正常的男生。只是说出来以后，我就会没有朋友了。我到底都积了什么孽缘？
谁的心是我最后一站？
我常问我自己；
现在还没有个答案
Just wish if I can end this miserable life one day.
新年愿望
找到一个可靠的另一半！
好累好累，只想一直不停的睡！
Now the journey starts.
传说中的好男人，好像都是爱上过同性以后，才升华成比异性恋还好的男人。
如果你也听说，有没有想过我？
爱一个人，就是把他的缺点都看成了优点。
生活里没有白马王子，只有平凡的农民，为自己的幸福努力耕耘。
总有一天，那个人会出现。带着我的未来，一起成长，一起努力。我期待。
此时此刻无数思绪涌上心头。好想有个人陪伴；但我告诉自己，再等一等，或许再等一下，幸福就来了。
Senior says that I have a calming and gentle voice. Wonder if you like it?
What am I worrying about?
小子，你看起来也蛮坏的。
爱上一个人，就会逐渐的失去自己，因为我们想同化自己，直到我们渐渐的失去了原本特别的自己。哪里去寻找有机的爱？多爱一会也不受伤害。
Im having confirmation bias...
Fantasies in my head. Wonder how well could you play.
I think I have a crush on you. You're always on my mind.
Yesterday was just crazy. Suddenly someone celebrate my birthday for me. Shocked.
I just felt so confused for my future. It sounds like a lonely December, like it always was.
Finish recording with a lengzai with many music skills. Damn, I felt like Im a bitch.
Zadou, it was a classical night and he was playing some non classical music
No wonder felt so weird, langsung no classic feel
He fills my mind. He was really amazing. Am I falling for someone, again? Cant I stop hurting myself? No one is reciprocating. No one.
Hmm, the guy is so handsome. Will he share the same interest with me? I wonder...
Nah, today is my bday and tomorrow is his. Amazing!
Super amazing talented guy in my school who plays piano, and the first person whom I salute. Wish to learn from him.
很好奇我一直以来是不是都不曾进入深层睡眠，都只是在REM sleep😰
小小年纪就这么花钱，以后上班了不就什么都拼命疯狂购物么？我对你的所作所为好失望。渐渐的，你走出了我的心房。或许又是一个新的开始。
Stupid lecturer, suddenly call up for class when we have rest for hours in 15 minutes, Im gonna make my complaint!
Felt worst yesterday, a bit better for today. Wish to get back to sleep!
Dear crush, please at least show me a way to get near you...I completely have no clue how to approach😭
Think of how to confess one day when I tell my crush how I feel. Cant wait for the day!!! Maybe Im not ready but I'll, try, for your love.
My eyes sore!!!
Reading lots and lots of sources.
Wish you were beside me to give a hug.
Not been sleeping well lately. Assignments and assignmentsssss
Exams and assignments. Gonna die hard. Psychology is so packed than what I thought of. This is INSANE!
Done writing storyline for I&amp;C assignment, filled with emotional scars. Confusion rise and fall. Who am I to judge for what is absolute?
Not sleeping well lately. My crush just finished EOS and gonna go home soon, how am I going to interact with him then? God, show me the way.
Just dream of my crush last night. It was so lovely, and I felt to get in to a relationship. Gonna meet counselor soon, makes me insomnia!
My crush does this, and I felt like to do this too.
Self-whispering, to remind how I felt all the while.
