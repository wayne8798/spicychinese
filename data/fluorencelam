1111 我想你了
我不知道在你心里我是否不一样
我希望在我想着你的同时你也想着我 :)
纯粹的不喜欢！别问我为什么！
不一样了！！
又再次蠢到～习惯了不该有的习惯！很讨厌这样的自己！我不想依赖他！
对待你越来越平静了！也证明我离目标不远了 :)
Actually....I still care abt it!!
我很努力的学着放下！
N ya!! Is the time!! Give up coz I know who u likes dy..thanks for all the memories u gave me for the past one year!!
U wil nvr know how painful m i when I heard that!!
Y u do that in front of me? Do u know it's hurt to see that!!!!!!!!!!
The moment u walked with her , the moment u played with her, the moment she played ur phone!! All these moments make my day an unhappy day!
This feeling is just...read dy but nvr reply..I hate this!!

Super tired..can't wait anymore..piggy pls be careful!!

Try my best to cheer u up..hope u wil be alright :) jiayou piggy..
Seriously hope myself can really put down
Wish u all the best for Tmr
越不让自己接近你，自己越痛苦！
U changed! No longer the one I knew!!
The feeling is back!! I DUN WANT!!!!
不想再次习惯不该有的习惯
突然害怕你回来！
I wil meet u in a week! Den I wil know whether I success or nt
As expected..
Missing u everyday
I used to something that I shouldn't
I just can't find any sign that u care abt me
Keep finding excuses for not giving u up..
Pls dun appear in my life at least for the rest of the month can?
I am nothing to u
Two weeks dy..but looks like there is no different.. Y u keep appear in my life?
My mind is all abt u when I pass through kl..
U wil nvr know how hurt m I when I saw that
Wishing that someday we wil be tgt but I know it's impossible
N there u appear again
看不到你都难放下了
好像越来越难让自己放下！
Y everytime I told myself to give up den there is something happen or u wil jus appear in my life again😪😪
Telling myself giving up is the best for both of us
Missing u everyday really kill me
For the first time..I very sure that I love him but he is someone that I can't love
