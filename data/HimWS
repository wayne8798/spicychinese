RT : MY NEW SINGLE IS FINALLY FINISHED AND READY TO GO!!!! 
Ughh finding a good accommodation for Year 2 is such a stressful thing to do :(
My frequent flyer points and miles are so messed up oh no :(
I'm still convinced that "Wild Heart" by  is a country song... Even more country than Taylor Swift tbh... Can't wait for 19 Jan
I like "Is There Anybody Out There"... It's fun and the songs are jolly. Great album. Just don't understand why such a "sad" album title
I'm just 18. Why do I have to deal with all these stuff.. this early
Apart from praying &amp; keep listening to Don't You Worry Child, I really don't know what to do. I'll never be ready to lose any family member

 你問我我實話唔值架喎xD 即管幫你吓價囉
 Warrior 分分鐘已經做緊買一送一lol
 Sainsbury's, Texco等超市連ARTPOP都劈(已劈到半價咁滯)，成日行過見到都好心痛:(
 $72係amazon公價，如果其他供應商/賣家最平連運費折合港幣$47.5，不過可能包裝無咁靚…Warrior (Deluxe Version) amazon頗貴，公價$107，最平$86，可以等我去hmv睇吓賤賣緊未先再決定… hmv好快將啲碟劈價架
@lcmjason 你諗清楚仲有無嘢想要，amazon依家要£10先free delivery，齋Timber係£4.14+1.49運費 (不過我可去hmv睇下有無先) :D
 有, 折合港紙要$72, 你係咪要

Counting Stars is definitely a sleeper hit for me. Didn't like it at first now I love it. :)
I laughed so hard... Mariah Carey failed twice at GMA. First we got Touch My Body playback fail, 2013 she cracked her #Beautiful voice lol

My first ever uni exam in 2 hours....... &gt;&lt;
 最好笑係佢成日去啲singing contest shows度perform (e.g. Dark Horse live at The Voice Germany)，分分鐘個個contestant都唱得好過佢...."
  仲有Katy成日話鍾意Birthday，分分鐘會係4th single…另外，This Is How We Do做summer single嘅呼聲好大，風格似係PRISM嘅Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)
A  featuring  song coming out next week?! Interesting collaboration! Can't wait to hear how their voices &amp; styles blend...
  其實Legendary Lovers &gt; Dark Horse係你嘅個人喜惡吧？我又唔覺得前者好聽過後者，而且Dark Horse係Unconditionally表現平平後明顯嘅safe choice喎……

I wonder is Gaga remaking Do What U Want MV w/ Rick Ross &amp; Christina... If that's the case that makes sense why it took so long to come out
Imagine Gaga releases this: Do What U Want - Lady Gaga feat. R. Kelly, Rick Ross &amp; Christina Aguilera... It can be Gaga's Lady Marmalade!!
First up MV of We Can't Stop was shocking, then Wrecking Ball kept us wow, and now Adore You, it's getting boring already. 
Turns out that Mary Jane Holland had became one of my favourite songs from ARTPOP. Top 5 I guess? What a great grower. :D
Officially Christmas here in GMT+8... #MERRYCHRISTMAS :D

This performance was particularly meaningful as critics and media were harsh on  &amp;  in the past year, music, body etc. #DWUW
Also that Sexxx Dreams intro... that was brilliant #VoiceFinale #DoWhatUWant  
The moment when  and  hold hands, gaga lean on xtina and they smash their glasses together..... I can't #voicefinale #DWUW

What is the point of all these labels. We're all humans, and I get to do what I want, love what I love.
No offense in my previous tweet...
What I don't understand is why the US people release 2 films related to White House being attacked in a row, like, do they really want that?
Just watched White House Down... It's a billion times better than Olympus Has Fallen.
Christina just got another Billboard Hot 100 top 10......... still not a solo song :L

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mi-i-i-i-i-i-i-ine

People are already walking on their desired paths, living their dreams, and i'm still sitting right here, figuring out who i really am...
I have no vision, no aim, no direction, and i seriously think i'm worthless all the time. I mean look at all the other people
I feel like i'm in a major identity crisis right now
Lol all i did was just posted a few Tom Daley gifs and i keep getting reblog/like notifications from tumblr all night long...
I don't need a lot of friends. Quality &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quantity
Seriously, I can only think of around 10 people from my Facebook friendlist that are my REAL friends.
I guess I can easily live without Facebook. It's just a news/info feeder and messenger for me anyway.
Almost 4am now. Still up. 9am lecture tmr. Good luck to myself...
I don't trust people that easy anymore. I don't like to interact with a random stranger who I probably won't speak to him/her ever again.
Unlike most of the people in this world, I don't want to be recognised or remembered. I don't want to be known. I'd rather known by nobody
You are alone? That doesn't make you lonely.
You feel lonely? You're not alone.
Nobody wants to be lonely, true, but I'd rather stay alone.
