don't tell me to smile or do anything to meet your expectations if you aren't prepared to be disappointed. or just don't say it.

": This is it "
i promised myself i'll be happy tonight and look where i am now.
looks like its still very possible to cry over you.
its weird how i still wonder whats in those dang private accounts of yours.
": You were the last person I expected to screw me over. I always defended you but you proved everyone right."
do you feel happy knowing you once insisted to stay, making someone hurt as you are hurting now? what could you do if she does the same now?
  actly i don't remember where you stay HAHAHAHAHAHA
