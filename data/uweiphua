  38啊你们
有时候，一个建议你离开的人，可能是最爱你的。一个希望你放弃的人，可能是最关心你的。一个渴求不再联系的人，可能是最挂念你的。一个默默离开的人，可能是最舍不得你的。我们的人生，就是在这样矛盾而纠结里渡过。爱并不是一场在一起的游戏，爱恰恰是种挂念你而不得不离开的痛楚。
一个人突然联系你了 正常 他在找备胎 突然不联系你了 也正常 你只是个备胎 有一天又联系你了 更正常 你是一个好备胎 接着又不联系你了 依然正常 有比你好的备胎出现了。

Waiting is stupid 😔

If you wake me up by turning on all the lights, there's a 100% chance that I've already started planning 10 different ways to kill you
RT : 为什么一些人可以在酱短的时间内变心，可以突然间说不爱就不爱，然后又在很短的时间内爱上另外一个。现在的感情是酱脆弱的吗？当感情有问题的时候不是应该找办法解决吗？为何不可面对它解决它而把它丢弃呢？如果下一个感情又有问题的时候，你又会一样的把它抛弃吗？
