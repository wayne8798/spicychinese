Learn to let go. Not everyone in your life is meant to stay.
Sometimes not giving a fuck is the only option.

It takes a real man to realize one woman is enough.
RT : A real boyfriend will blow up his girl's phone when she's mad at him. She may not want to answer, but at least she'll see …
我只想用我这一辈子去爱你，从今以后你会是所有.

the scary thing about dating is that you are either going to marry that person or break up
if only we can remain like this forever.

I know everything happens for a reason. But sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.

You're the type I don't wanna lose.
Relationships would be easier if people came with a 'Clear History' button

when someone special walks into your life and is able to change things for the better, don't ever let them walk away 
Anytime you whisper my name, I will be there 
永远，存在吗？
