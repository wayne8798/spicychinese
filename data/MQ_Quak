未来的路还那么的漫长
世上的傻人真是多得数不清
你就继续自暴自弃吧。错了一次还想要再错第二次。虽然大家都苦口婆心地劝导你，但你却把我们的话当耳边的风。我们的关怀对你来说简直是一文不值的垃圾。谁好谁坏，你难道分不出来吗？近朱者赤 近墨者黑。 你难道一点理性也没有吗？还是你觉得旷课是对大家的一种威力，显示自己有多么的大胆？傻人一个

Homework homework homework all haunting me
Who do you think my mum is, taking my mum for granted?
Dun feel like studying😴😴😴
Definitely having PMS
The train is so empty on a Chinese New Year Eve
It's a new day, filled with hope. See things in a positive light. Things can't be that bad. Everything happens for a reason.
It's only when you know you are not comparable to them, will you start to complain about these foreigners. This is an act of insecurity
Why do Singaporeans need to complain about recruitment in Singapore? As long as you have the ability and talent, why care about others?
Racial harmony day in Chinese schools —a group of Chinese wearing different ethnic costumes and celebrating only with Chinese. DefeatPurpose
The moment when you see your friend being so 无助, but you can't do a single thing to help.
GOD, i think i am turning more and more like HIM. Why? I don't want this to happen. PLEASE NO..
The society just doesn't give a single shit. Yes, so obsessed with economy and all. One day the world will collapse from humans' obsessions
It is not able to give you true and permanent happiness.
Ya successful my foot. How successful is this, drifting my life off for the sole purpose of getting MONEY. Money can only fulfil your 虚荣心
All we are told is to study hard, best to go jc, uni, and go for jobs like auditor, business management ETC. and be so "successful".
Are all these materialistic gains so important? My dear society?
Come on, you are just enhancing our logical and linguistic intelligence. How about interpersonal intelligence? How about other intelligence?
Screw this man. I'm so sick of this materialistic society
"It does not matter how many times you fall..." Ya, the more you fall, the more you'll see how people are mocking at you from afar
You are expected to the best of the best because you have been so. But hey i am just a friggin human
 lol.. Yaa okk.. Just emo-ing away
You can only depend on yourself. You cannot depend on others. This is life.
The truth is, nobody will give a single shit. For a second they try to sympathize. And in the next second, poof they are gone. U r w/ urself
Yes i am trying so well to be optimistic, but everything seems to be going against me
Everything seems to be bombarding me all at once
I really don't know if i can carry on
Such friggin assholes don't deserve to be in this world. You ought to be damned, condemned to hell.
RT : Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.

相信就是强大。怀疑只会抑制能力，而信仰却是力量
Remember that people will always question the good things they hear about you, and believe the bad ones without a second thought.
When your friend just keeps on putting others before herself. And you just feel like, so sad, so sad...
Feel like sleeping now and wake up at 4 in the morning to do homework. Really z z z already😴😴😴
Worst mindset ever: I think i can -&gt; i try to do it -&gt; i made a mistake -&gt; i don't know if i can continue this -&gt; i think i can't -&gt; I CANT!
Half-heartedness brings you nowhere. How can you expect to succeed when you only devout half of your heart and soul?
Do things with conviction and not half-heartedly
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will
How can you do a certain thing well when you are not even confident of your own abilities?

Yes, serve me right that all these have to fall on me
My first mistake would be when i initiated a conversation with you
If given a choice, i would choose not to meet you at all
If given a choice, i would have wiped him off my memory entirely
He's hurt you so much. He's been so selfish to you. He doesn't even care about you. Why are you still thinking about him?
And you just know that you can't forget about him. No matter how much you try not to think about him, he still pops up in your mind
Having flu😑 SADLIFE
