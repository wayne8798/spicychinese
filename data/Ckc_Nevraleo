 不客气👌
 心累到停止跳动，才能睡到永远都不起来。
人累了可以睡一觉，心累了怎么办?
什么叫快乐？就是掩饰自己的悲伤对每个人微笑。
其实我没那么坚强, 我只是学会了假装.
You know what? I believe I deserve what I want. My life, my choice, I live the way I want. It's none of your business. Thank You.
别把自己想的太伟大，要知道，在别人的世界里，不管你做的多好，你都只是个配角而已。
Yeah, and pretending starts all over again.
Think about this , did you really said things that you mean it?
What the fuck is this
Fuck all this shit .
Yeah you get what you want. you happy now ?
Understanding isn't hard if you put in the effort.
Really, who are you to say that. I deserve what I want.
''Eccedentesiast'' is someone who hides their pains behind a smile, when all they want to do is hide and/or die. Are you one of them?
Love Is not necessarily forever, but It can be
You can't have a better tomorrow if you're still thinking about yesterday.
You will never be happy if you continue to hold on to the things that make you sad.
I hate how we went from being strangers, to friends, to close friends, to almost something more, to nothing.
I won't even bother trying.
There always be a reason for everything happen.
Never give up on what you love.
If it's worth it, then it's worth the wait.
That's call dying to know, afraid to find out
Just because we don't talk anymore, that doesn't mean I don't still think about you.
It's hard to pretend that you love someone when you don't, but it's even harder to pretend that you don't love someone when you really do.
RT : 喜欢一个人不代表我们一定要跟他们在一起
I never let you go, because in the back of my mind, I still believe that someday we'll get our second chance(;
Falling in love with you was never an option.
Everything thing that kills me makes me feel alive
RT : Right person, wrong time. I hate that.
RT : Those late night texts where you just confess everything.
RT : I wish I could tell you everything I feel about you, and if you don't feel the same way. We could still be friends without…
我再多强调最后一次，我是不会轻易放弃的。够了，别再多说了，我爱你。
你为何又没有告诉我真正原因。
够了，我是不会改变主意的。
I won't give up, because I'm still waiting for the impossible to happen
我不明白你。
让我再说最后一次，我是不会放弃的。
是，我不是很了解你，但我很努力地去了解你，可是，你有尝试让我知道吗？你把你自己封闭在自己的世界里，你从不告诉我你真正的感受，‘我很好’一直以来都是你的标准答案。你说你还没准备好，没问题，我给你时间。但是，你又为何要一而再地把我推开呢？我从来都不后悔爱你，以后也不会。
我会等你
Choose your love, Love your choice.
If I'm the cause of everything, I'm sorry.
Don't let it affect anything else.
You know , i meant what i said. I always do.
If you really love that person, be patient maybe you are not meant to be together today but meant to be in the future.
We don't meet people by accident. They are meant to cross our path for a reason.
It's this gonna be the ending of the story?
Don't feel sorry about that , I have time, I could wait .
You can never "just be friends" with someone you fell in love with.
Getting together is not about deserving or not deserving, it doesn't matter. What matter most is that we both are happy together.
Falling in love with you will not be mistake.
RT : Expect the unexpected
  exactly. then who are you to say i deserve better.
  No, U shut up. She's everything I want.
  I don't agree
 My tweets, my problems, not happy, unfollow me, dont complain.You get it?
Say nothing, I love you.
 I want you to reply me now, right now, stop avoiding
You told me you're fine.
You told me not to worried.
Hopefully you will be fine.
Let's go study
I love you
You know you can't just keep quiet like this, I'm worried.
You deserve all this.
You know i'm always here for you.
RT :  Janette
I'm single but I know who exactly I want.
Yes, I'm thinking about you right now.
How I wish I am with you right now
Please don't hide things from me that keep me wondering and worrying...just be honest with me no matter what.
Missing someone makes it harder to fall asleep at night.
I care about you more than you think.
I will never say "I love you" unless I mean it 100%.
I'm here for you. Through whatever, whenever.
  'You're fine.'
RT : I'm fine
I'm worried.
Knowing someone has a problem and you can't do anything about it.
Dying inside.
 Alright
What happen?
You're sad? I'll cheer you up. You're upset? I'd love to listen. All you have to do is come to me, you know I'll be there for you
If you truly love someone, all you want is for them to be happy.
Trust me, I won't.
All I want is for you to tell me straight up what you really feel.
For all the love I found in you.
Don't rush anything. When the time is right, it'll happen.
She didn't tweet those song lyrics for no reason. There's always a reason.
I really like you, give me a chance and give yourself a chance.
You're everything I want.
 Hell yes😂👌👍
 NAH I AM the most awesome 😂
盈睿是世界上最棒的人
如果你想拥有你从未有过的东西，那么你必须去做你从未做过的事情。
 THANKS.BUT I THINK U DESERVE THIS 😂

That someone that make your life interesting
 FINE
I wonder who.
You know it better sucker~
 YOU SUCK THE MOST, FULL STOP.
Of Course you are.
Why should I? I deserve an award at least!
Retarded you is retarded.
看着你难过，而我却不能帮上忙，只能眼睁睁地看着你难过。。。
难受够了，是时候向前进了。
The past is in the past, learn from it and move on.
过去的就让它过去吧。
一时的失败，不代表永远的失败，终有一天，一定会成功的。
You're sad? I'll cheer you up. You're upset? I'd love to listen. All you have to do is come to me, you know I'll be there for you
我不知如何让你开心，但请振作起来。
Everything is gonna be alright
 休息，是为了走更长远的路。
  You have to.
时间，真的过得很快。
大便地理
今天要开夜车了。。。。
你不会争取你想要的东西吗？
你存在 我深深的脑海里
 K WHATEVER.
Say nothing i aint giving up on you
Shine bright like a diamond then.
  You can obtained heat from the sun, more eco-friendly.
  No Fire pls, its dangerous.
  SHUT UP.
The best things in life come with patience.
When we first met, I had no idea that you'd become this important to me.
  Wth ._.
  YES JUST FRIENDS (:
Pls I have no time to entertain shits, I have tests 😂
 Ckc like everyone pls, except those fuckers.
Of course i do, fucker.
 SHUDDUP YOU ARE MORE ANNOYING

 Retarded asshole tweets 😂😑
 Shuddup.😂
I'm missing you.
  PLS😂👌
 BLOODY HELL I COULD HAVE WIN MORE
 👌👍😄
 I see😂 I wish you all the best!👌👍
  I ain't that shallow alright. How's life there ?😄
Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.
 TOO BAD😂
不要着急，最好的总会在最不经意的时候出现。
You have no idea how much I like you, how much you make me smile, how much I love talking to you, or how much I wish you were mine.
You have no idea how much you mean to me.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
I wish nothing but the best for you
I know that I'll make it there eventually
But trying to move on only hurts
I truly love you, only you.
 You're welcome 👌😊
The moment that you realize that you  can't do anything about your life anymore that the only thing that you can do is to move on.
People usually don't express their true feeling.
Wonderful you is wonderful.
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.
Don't let your dreams just be dreams.
RT : Pursuing something is ideal, just make sure you don't run away from it .
Live your life to the fullest.
Life without you is like tree without blossoms or fruit.
It's getting closer.
Well Fortunate or Unfortunate.
A day without you is like a day without sunlight.
Having the presence of you is so good
 That aint fucker, that is awesome.
 I ain't one 😂
 😂👌👍
 I'm lucky okay?! Not like someone 😂
 I AINT LAME OKAY, YOU ARE.
You are worth waiting.
 Hahahahaha
You never fail to make me smile
 Why not 😂
 WHY😂
 How you know I win 😂
Sometimes you just need a twist and turn
"I do like you a lot, but I guess I won't stand a chance of having you"😂 
Guys what I meant was this 
I do like you a lot , but I guess I don't  stand  a chance of having you.
 Of Course.😂
  SINCE WHEN DID I SAY YOURE NOT NICE?😂
 HOW THE HELL IS IT NOT TRUE PLS😂
Never argue with a women, even if they're wrong. What's the point when you win women in an argument. They get angry, You still lose out.
So now my parents thought I'm gay 😂
Maybe it's just not the time yet
People often don't tell how they feel
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.
Sometimes we all have that hard decision to be made.
A lot of people don't want to make their own decisions. They're too scared. It's much easier to be told what to do.
Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can change your life forever.
Sometimes, that something means a lot to someone.
 👌😂 REPLY
RT : Am I the only one who doesn't play flappy bird hahaha
