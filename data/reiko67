很久了，我们不说话，已很久了。不说，那就不说吧！我知道这样的开始，就已意味着什么了。没有放不下的东西，伤心了自然会放下。等到某月某日，你我变成陌生人，那就什么都没有了。那时候我会对你说 ：祝你幸福！这或许很乏味，却是我对你感情的全部倾注。你带着这句话，离开吧. :')

Thinking of what to wear. Very casual, casual, or serious type of casual. It's almost 10pm, and I just started to dress up and head out.
Feels that actually my Chinese New Year celebration haven't started at all. Timing all went wrong.

Shocked me to death when I can't find the watch. Note to self: Never ever put the watch else where beside my bag in this house.
 not a single trace of Donnie Yen at all. Even his voice were dubbed. Sobs!
Tell me, what is the point of drinking and getting drunk with the extended family?
what is the point of tagging others name in a big head of yourself again? A plain status of greetings wouldn't be that bad, right?
Pressing "refresh" and checking on phone like a mad woman. Why should I?
Snacking when watching My Bounty Lady with extended family. Finally some feel of Chinese New Year. Lol.
Oh ya, Happy Chinese New Year Twittersphere. A bit late I know. &gt;&lt;
Reading bout The Holocaust after finished watching Schindler's List on Chinese New Year Day 2. Hmm...
The boring kind of funny in a gathering, ya'll know what I mean?
RT : Oh god. CNY I can't get up.
What movie to watch on Chinese New Year's Eve? Any good recommendation?
Still, no feel of celebrating Chinese New Year. Am I sick or what?

Sucks to be him seriously. Couldn't imagine if I were him, or if he's my brother or cousin or friend I know in real life. Fucked up mess.
Some more it's not like you know him in real life or the neighbor you hate or something. Most of us just dislike him bcs of peer pressure.
I find that people shouldn't make fun of Justin Bieber being arrest. A soul took a wrong turn, what's so funny bout that?

I am number four. 
Now that this is happening, but I'm not sure that I am genuinely happy.
消失了一天
你想我吗？
请原谅我的不告而别
也许这是最适合我们的道别方式

我要的真的不多
我只希望在我难过无助的时候
有一个人能支持我帮助我
可是这并不存在于我们的相处模式里
给了我们和时间很多时间
失望…
