RT : No matter how busy a person is, if they care, they'll find time for you.
RT : People don’t notice the things you do for them until you stop doing them.
RT : Just remember, someone loves everything you hate about yourself.
RT : You don't need anyone in your life who doesn't want to be there.
RT : Sometimes you just need to put the past away and move on with your life.
RT : Be happy with who you are, stop letting other people put you down.
RT : Forgiving someone is easy, it's trusting them again that's hard.
RT : There are two things you should never waste your time on: things that don’t matter and people that think you don’t matter.
RT : Life will get much better when you stop caring about what everyone thinks, and start to actually live for yourself.
RT : You will never truly understand something until it actually happens to you.
RT : Sometimes the hardest things in life are what make you the strongest.
RT : Over thinking kills happiness, insecurities kill self-esteem and lies kills trust.
RT : You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings.
