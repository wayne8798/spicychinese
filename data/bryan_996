Sometimes, to get the best out of life, you go through some of the worst. No one said it would be easy. Be strong. 
RT : "I Love You" means that I care enough to fight for what we have and that I love enough not to let go.

Happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands,but if you let it go, and you'll learn at once how big and precious it is.
Never abandon an old friend. You will never find one who can take his place. Friendship is like wine,… 
Appreciate those who love you. Help those who need you. Forgive those who hurt you. Forget those who leave you. &lt;3
