Mentally prepared! 2014 comes at me!
要处理的事情很多 要做的家务很多 要解决的账单很多 没有什么好怕的 我都可以做到!
RT : I wanna be beautiful enough for you.
RT : If you don't take your diet serious... then you're wasting your time in the gym.
该讲的都讲了 完整了 哈哈哈
RT : what korean dramas taught me 
很久没有这种感觉了 哈哈哈
Mcdzcdsjydddr.
 what's that?
RT : Best Relationship: Talk like bestfriends, play like children, argue like husband &amp; wife, protect each other like brothe…
RT : The bravest thing a girl can do is love without fear.
Looked back to my timeline when everyone told me to take care before my first depart. So sweet having all of you!
要调回生理时钟 现在就要起来了。
To my precious yolo team, you guys are way more important than you think you are to me. Thanks for being here in all these months :)
There is a line. The end of the story.
RT : People say "never give up" but sometimes giving up is the best option because you realize you're wasting your time.
Seeing them two getting better finally I feel relieved XD
Just know that we are having steamboat now hahaha
RT : Don't fall in love with his words, fall in love with his actions.
Why are all these stuffs so freaking annoying
So bored
真的需要很大的勇气
Just need to hold on a little more.
Normal people go through pain but people with story get through it!
我知道初二不能哭
 Happy CNY XiaoShinShin! :D
 新年快乐 我的好伙伴!
 Happy New Year!!
Sometimes i wonder if there is anyone who is weirder than me and then I see my mum hahahahaha
This made my day hahahaha 
RT : 每个人心底都有那么一个人，已不是恋人，也成不了朋友。 时间过去，无关乎喜不喜欢，总会很习惯的想起你。然后希望你一切都好。
RT : 里面包含了我多少绝望和不甘心 如果你懂。
 哦！
RT : 想你，但不打扰，静静的思念就好，把最后一点尊严留给自己。
You can tell how bored we are when we insisted to facetime even though both of us are in pontian..
The same feeling as two years ago. the fear of losing leaving and missing.
有力吗?! 
时间过了几年 长大了一些
RT : Time and good friends are two things that become more valuable the older you get.
  didny see you enough
只是有一些话 一直往心里藏
  of course I"ll tell you both
 i'll tell you later 〈3
Damn.
3 more weeks and I'm leaving. 如果这个世界可以少一点离别 我该省下不少眼泪.
RT : If there are no wrinkles below the eyelid, the smile is fake.
WORK hard play hard 
慢慢等 慢慢等 等到我都睡着了
Enjoying the moment like this :D Work hard!!!
So good to have the friends who can share the joy with you 〈3

学会遗憾之前 先懂得珍惜. 
Just need a little faith! :D 
生活越简单 人就越快乐 也就越幸福 :)
We never try to be perfect but we always want to be better. Work hard play hard and work even harder! 
There is some random moment when you just don't feel like talking at all for no reason.
Knowing what to do and what can't I do.
 运动当时会很累 可是过后真的很爽！
Somehow two wrongs make a twisted right
More like a maid kld hahaha

为什么我突然感觉很黯淡
家家都有本难念的经 唉
总有一些这样的女孩 他们自己赚钱给自己花 她们相信爱情 她们可能生活在异乡她们满身伤痕却不哭给别人看。 在别人眼里 她们总光彩照人 而其实不过坚强活着.每个女孩都有自己的了不起… 
总是有这样的一些女孩，她们自己赚钱给自己花，她们相信爱情，她们可能生活在异乡，她们满身伤痕却不哭给别人看。在别人眼里，她们总光彩照人，而其实不过是坚强的活着……每个女孩，都有自己的了不起。你的优秀，不需要任何人来证明。因为女人最大的精彩，就是独立。
天高地厚-信 不管世界尽头多寂寞 你的身边一定有我 可以一起闯祸一起沉默一起走 可以一起飞翔一起沦落 我有我想要的朋友  
  nabu very sincere ok hahahahh but seriousl when you have the power to make people laugh, do it!
 没关系 痛过就好了 我扶你 :P
不管怎样 不能让家人担心 要让朋友安心.
The nightmare i can't get over no matter how. but still have to remain 欢喜
把自己的快乐 建筑在别人的痛苦上 一点都不好笑 屌

 woooohoooooo !!!!
 哈哈哈哈 没有啦 心情一直都很不错 只是突然有一点感触 哈哈哈哈 就觉得人生也没有什么好难过的 开心就好
有些难过是自己制造出来的 明明可以挽回 却因为自己的犹豫不决而耽搁了 真正的难过却是在你最不经意的时候 让你措手不及 可以是突然失去家人的痛苦 突然失去爱人的伤痛 当你真的失去这些 不要说开口的勇气 连再见到一面的机会都没有了 所以我希望我们都可以明白
Dont know what to do now hahhahahah
#np Dark horse &lt;3
难得回来结果没有电话用 哈哈哈 用这个好了 为什么会什么都没有做 可是心情还是很好啊 哈哈哈哈 
三点睡 7点半起来 在家里的感觉不一样就是不一样 精神奕奕!
原本很饱的 跑得又饿了
好烦
真的不知道为什么每个哥哥都那么好 平时对自己那么省 可是我想要什么 都毫不犹豫的会买给我 谢谢 :)
 why not?
我丢不掉 舍不得都丢掉
='(
选择没有对或错 只有后悔跟不后悔
辜战 〈3
  hahahahahahhahahahahahaha both status and reply just made my night
其实还是很失望 算了
 哈哈哈哈 不是我啦 我心情很好
有什么好气的 付出不一定就会有回报 因为就算你很努力了 别人还是看不到
