每一个优秀的人 都有一段沉默的时光 那一段时光 是付出了很多努力 忍受孤独和寂寞 不抱怨 不诉苦 日后说起时 连自己都能被感动的日子。

RT : 里面包含了我多少绝望和不甘心 如果你懂。
 哦！
RT : 想你，但不打扰，静静的思念就好，把最后一点尊严留给自己。

总有一些这样的女孩 他们自己赚钱给自己花 她们相信爱情 她们可能生活在异乡她们满身伤痕却不哭给别人看。 在别人眼里 她们总光彩照人 而其实不过坚强活着.每个女孩都有自己的了不起… 
总是有这样的一些女孩，她们自己赚钱给自己花，她们相信爱情，她们可能生活在异乡，她们满身伤痕却不哭给别人看。在别人眼里，她们总光彩照人，而其实不过是坚强的活着……每个女孩，都有自己的了不起。你的优秀，不需要任何人来证明。因为女人最大的精彩，就是独立。
天高地厚-信 不管世界尽头多寂寞 你的身边一定有我 可以一起闯祸一起沉默一起走 可以一起飞翔一起沦落 我有我想要的朋友  
  nabu very sincere ok hahahahh but seriousl when you have the power to make people laugh, do it!
