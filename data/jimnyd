RT : To build a great RELATIONSHIP, use trust as brick and patience as cement because sometimes, love isn't enough.
“Patience &amp; Love go hand in hand in the developement of any successful relationship. If you love them you'll be patient with them.” 
“A relationship without communication is like a fish without water, dead” this is what I said since day 1!! 
RT :   amen!! This is so true and so correct. Thanks baby girl you understand me so well =)
“When you communicate better with your partner the blaming game will stop and you 2 will learn to solve problems with each other.” 
“Forgiving is letting it go, not storing it to use for ammo in the next argument” 
“Dont say sorry unless u mean it and dont forgive if you're not ready to move past it” 
“You both act certain ways because of y'all scars. Be understanding and help each other heal.” 
“If u can't open up to ur partner then there's not as much trust or communication as u think there is” 
“Speak Up. If something is bothering you, it's best to talk about it instead of holding it in.” 
“Listen to your partner, stop assuming you know what they're going to say or think they're wrong all the time. Let them speak!” 
“: Any woman can seek a successful man but only a true woman can support a man prior to his success” 
RT : No matter how much you know they love you, you'll have doubt sometimes. Humans by nature tend to doubt good things.
RT : Sex can bring pleasure but it can never bring love. Sex is a product of love, love isn't a product of sex.
RT : When you're shopping, do you put items on hold just to control the impulse to buy? Do you go back to buy it?
RT : Do you think you can change a man? #bethennytv
RT : Happiness is cuddling with my furry baby.
