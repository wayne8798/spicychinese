RT : 有时候我会觉得你很难懂 难搞
 Ohh ~
 What happened ??
RT : Sometimes you have to move on, no matter how hard it is.
RT : The best relationships start off as friendships.
RT : I know he's not the cutest guy in the world, but still, there's something about him that makes my heart drop.
": Don't stress about the closed doors behind you. New doors are opening if you keep moving forward."
RT : I'm not okay but I smile.
RT : I forgive people, but that doesn't mean I trust them.
RT : I feel like an idiot for missing you...
RT : Behind every beautiful girl, there's a guy who did her wrong and made her strong.
RT : 不要过分在乎身边的人，也不要刻意去在意他人的事。在这世上总会有人让你悲伤、让你嫉妒、让你咬牙切齿。并不是他们有多坏，而是因为你很在乎。所以想心安，首先就要不在乎。你对事不在乎，它就伤害不到你；你对人不在乎，他就不会令你生气。在乎了你就已输…
RT : 你相信吗？友情世界里也存在着吃醋，那滋味不亚于爱情
RT : I'm single but I know exactly who I want.
RT : I can't read your mind, just tell me how you feel.
RT : I wonder who this is 😒😔 
RT : 对我来说只是个普通的星期五
RT : I need someone who won’t give up on me, no matter how many times I mess up.
RT : I miss you, the old you. The new one sucks.
RT : walk into school tomorrow like 
RT : 有时候写东西想发泄还得顾虑多多 真的很累很不喜欢。想要找一个比较少人玩比较少人看的地方发泄
RT : 做什么，在哪里，怎样其实都不重要，重要是和谁一起。
RT : No one really understands me.
RT : 有时候朋友做到这种地步有点悲哀
RT : 有些人，有些事，该忘就忘了吧，人家从没把你放心里过，你又何必自作多情。
RT : 当你发现再也记不起为了什么而受伤，那就是痊愈之时。
RT : Changing a whole text message just because you don't know how to spell one word.
Shit u ! 23 min
Damn it !! Whr r u ?!!
damn it i miss you
RT : 一辈子那么长，一天没走到终点，你就一天不知道哪一个才是陪你走到最后的人。有时你遇到了一个人 以为就是她了，后来回头看，其实她也不过是这一段路给了你想要的东西
RT : I notice everything, I just act like I don't.
": 忘不掉的是回忆，继续的是生活，错过的，就当是路过。"
RT : 我想 留一头及腰的黑发 减到满意的体重 交一个能在失眠时聊天的朋友 将来考上一所让家人满意的大学然后 彻彻底底跟这里的一切道别
RT : You make me smile so easily..
RT : Be thankful for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
RT : Lol I hope. 
RT : 渐渐的知道了，很多东西可遇而不可求，不属于自己的，何必拼了命去在乎。
RT : 别说明天或者以后是不会成功的，今天的太阳和明天的太阳还是一样会亮，地球还是每天一样在转动，只是今天的奋斗精神不知和明天的是不是一样
RT : ❤️ 
RT : Hardest thing to answer: 

Describe yourself.
": When a million things can bring you down, find one reason to keep you up."
RT : Excuses are useless. Results are priceless.
RT : When I'm alone, I overthink.
RT : i wonder how people describe me when they’re talking about me to someone who’s never met me before
RT": Best friends. "
RT : 
The 3rd day of the new year! :D #chor#3#ootd#new#year#happy

RT : Behind every beautiful girl, there's a guy who did her wrong and made her strong.
RT : I miss how close we were.
RT : 比起分手后的伤痛，对方比自己先一步开始新恋情才是更让人受不了的事。
RT : 有些人，你以为可以一直见面的；有些事，你以为可以一直继续的。然后也许就在你转身的那个刹那，有些人你永远也见不到了，有些事情永远不会继续了。当太阳落下又升起来的时候，一切都变了。一个不小心，就再也回不去了。
RT : When I'm alone, I overthink.
RT : LILO &amp; STITCH 
RT : 
RT : 很多人都不知道自己想要什么。其实是没有勇气面对和足够的努力去争取自己想要的。

RT : I'm glad I met you, I hope you know that.
RT : ok where is this boy? 🙌🙏✌ 
RT : 
RT : 天秤座超级爱忘事，并不是脑子不好，只是单纯不记事；喜欢乱想，然后黯然神伤；心太软，太容易感动；直脾气，有什么说什么，常常口无遮拦；很固执，不懂得放弃；典型的外冷内热，对陌生人文静的要命，对好友却闹起来像个孩子。
RT : 一个无声的拥抱，对一颗不快乐的心来说，就是千言万语了。
RT : RT if you want this 
RT : Why am i afraid to lose u if ur not even mine. 😓
RT : 我是完全很忍受不到你这样的脾气
RT : 你奢望每个人都忍受你 妈的谁来让我们出气

RT : 心，会隐藏我们不能说的东西，但眼睛，能说出我们试图隐藏的东西。
RT : how to get over your ex 🙌

虽然从来就不会这样觉得
从以前到现在的变化真的好大
RT : this is so freaking gorgeous, I am in love 😍😍 
RT : definition of a perfect boyfriend 
RT : So so so true 
RT : 上天安排我们与某些人相遇，是有原因的。上天若又安排他们离开我们，那是因为有更好的原因。请珍惜每一刻相处的时光，因为我们不知道哪一次再见，会变成再也不见。
RT : "Sorry for the late reply" 

Me: 
RT : Fight for me, and I promise you I will do the same.
RT : 好吧，让过去的过去，明天又是新的开始

如果我是从那个纸带拿出来,酱另外一个纸袋去哪里了???
kanasai 我到底放去哪里了
RT : I admit, when I'm in a bad mood, EVERYTHING annoys me.
RT : Train your mind to see the good in everything.
RT : 不要轻易说爱，也不要假装对我好，我很傻，会当真的。我更害怕痛过之后就不会觉得痛了，有的只会是一颗冷漠的心。对于感情的戏，我没演技。我情愿一个人习惯，习惯难受，习惯思念，习惯等你。
RT : After someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore.
RT : She wants a boy to look at her while she's smiling with friends and doing stupid things and she wants him to think "damn, I…

RT : The hardest thing is not talking to someone you used to talk to everyday.
RT : 可以影响你心情的人，在你心里一定很重要吧。
RT : 我想有一天，我跟一个人足够契合，我们可以一整天没有电脑没有手机，可以吃着好吃的，听着音乐，聊着天南地北的话题，甚至于两两相望静静的坐一整天也很自然 。无论友情，还是爱情。

RT : There are so many things can make you happy. Don't focus too much on things that make you sad.
RT : Never give up on something you really want.
