這樣明明愛你卻要騙自己　
是我害怕未來沒有了你
不言又不語　不理也不應　
是這世上最殘酷的徒刑
我只能　明明愛你卻要騙自己　
騙到最後自己都不相信
我的在乎帶走我的勇氣　
一個人自言自語是我習慣的回應

Late night thoughts that kills
谁说爱情一定要携手花开？有的人，注定是一个过客，匆匆在你生命里出现，只为了给你上一课，然后匆匆离开，让你心智更成熟。妳说过，有多爱便有多痛，有多痛便有多疯。最后有没有在一起，真的有那么重要吗？知道彼此爱过其实是给自己最好的安慰。。

RT : 有时候，我们愿意原谅一个人，并不是我们真的愿意原谅他，而是我们不愿意失去他。道歉并不总意味着你是错的，它只是意味着你更珍惜你们之间的关系。爱，不是寻找一个完美的人，而是学会用完美的眼光，欣赏一个不完美的人。专一不是一辈子只喜欢一个人，是喜欢一个…
