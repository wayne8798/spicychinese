RT 两个人非常渴，喝同一口井水时，一个用金杯，一个用泥杯。前者觉得自己富贵，后者认为自己贫贱；前者得到了虚荣的满足，后者陷入无谓的烦恼中。他们都忘了，自己需要的是“水”，而不是“盛水的杯”。我们在生活中也是如此，不要被自己不需要的东西所烦恼。

RT : One of the worst things in life is when you step in water while wearing socks.
你以为你对他的想念，已经到了极致了，已经不可能想念得更多了，结果，在某一个意想不到的时刻，你又成功的，比原来想他的程度，再更多想念他一点点。
Remember when we used to talk about this movie and laughed at the same scene over &amp; over again. 😂

RT 别人要你做什么，你就做什么，最后会变成苦力。别人需要你时就出现，不需要你时就消失，会慢慢失去自我。做人最大的问题，就是不会拒绝。因为在这个世界上，会哭的孩子有奶喝。你拒绝的越多，得到的才越多。做人就是，忍辱负重的吃苦，挑三拣四才享福。说不，才能得到，懂得拒绝，活得不纠结。
RT : “: Every freaking time...  ”
😭😭😭😭😭
CDG CDG 😢
I will love you unconditionally.
'Bojio, bojio, bojio' Yeah, fuck you.
Hectic.

I forgive but I don't forget.
I know life would suck without you.
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say. Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face.
Like I having nothing better to do.
记得你曾经说过
RT 端起一杯水很容易，如果以不变的姿势端起一小时呢？恐怕你的胳膊就会酸痛难忍了。要是让你端起一天？你一定会叫救命了。如果，放下来休息一下，再端起来就不会感觉到累。-生活中也会有些事让我们感到很沉重，一直扛着，就会压垮身体，放下来或是暂时的放下，就会发现背负着的或许没有那么沉重。
 I'm good girl. Must obey what mama said 😆 must tahan tahan!
