今天整個好嗨
本以為沒有丞琳a眾星演唱會會使我無聊
而且最近比較疏遠中文歌的我有點可憐...新歌都沒聽過
但大家都實力派來著啊聽的好過癮

讓我心動：丁噹、ALIN、蕭敬騰
你們三個讓我超激動現在喉嚨整個有腫痛的現象... 
我她媽聽到阿佼說天后還以為是丞琳 坑爹 
雖然不能去看黛咪的演唱會
不過這個也是很不賴哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈 
今天一早就在醫院奔波好幾診直到剛剛
感觸很多 唉
等1下要去看留/遊學展，要趕快轉換一下心情
晚上才可以釋懷，好好迎接無丞琳的KKBOX演唱會
唉 多久沒看到妳了啊啊啊
結果好不容易這樣那樣 然後妳不會出現是怎lol
算了，拍戲加油
如果黛咪變成這樣我放棄哈哈哈哈哈 
......
【摩羯座】
1、吃軟不吃硬。
2、經常口是心非。
3、很樂觀又很悲觀。
4、安全感不多，有點感性。有些話即使害怕錯過也不說。
5、常常被人騙。有點小心軟、小敏感、小潔癖。...
