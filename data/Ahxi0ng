你常解釋這樣的一切都只是開始 我覺得是所有的一切早就已結束 不想再約束不要再痛苦 下一次會有更好的情路
你想要的 我卻不能夠給你我全部 我能給的卻又不是你想要擁有的 我們不適合也不想認輸 好幾次我們抱著彼此都是想要哭
有时候是需要压印的。
Cursed life is forever a cursed life unable to turn the table around at all..
我只能这样默默地付出就行了。
Well I guess whatever I have learn doesn't really matter at all..
This isn't a game of winning or losing...
可能这就叫做爱吧？
有时候一厢情愿也是值得的。
