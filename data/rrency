情人本是同林鸟,大难临头各自飞。
If someone is angry over silly or small things, it means he/she needs love. Some people will never understand this.

Sometimes when ego took over your mind, you don't realize that you're in the wrong until it's over.
Moved on means it never happen before?
The next one must be someone that never wants to leave. #hopeful
Her reason is that she is now a office person, cannot accept a lorry driver. :))
