Getting really annoying.
RT : New BS Report: a 2-parter from the Bud Light Hotel in NYC with Colin Kaepernick and @housefromdc -- 
Yep, I want baseball.
Woooooooopo 
I'm only watching Nashville for Avery right now.
I don't blame my guys. It's pretty much mission impossible right now.
Someone needs to step the fuck up.
There are ppl stalking Kap in NY!?
You are fucking kidding me right?
 你妈是什么反应？
Guess it's time to panic.
Trying to avoid twitter these days. Never getting good news from here.
I miss the Jimmy in S2. He was the right guy for Fi.
I can't see this team winning any games right now. Need these starters back. And TP needs some rest too. Sth is bothering him!
First time I find an on-screen kiss creep as hell.
Fuck this shit.
 你在这里说话吧，我会看着回的。😘
 做梦吧你在 加上我现在枫叶卡还没补好，哪都没得去。
I saw that one coming though, why cast a hot guy to play Fiona's bf's brother?
I'm speechless after watching the new shameless episode...
我今天听到一件我听过最恐怖的事情，一个男的跟我说他11岁没了贞操，是被他的邻居一个已婚妇女夺走的。在一个停电的晚上把一个11岁大的男孩子勾引去，被玩然后就搞上了。这活生生的一个恋童癖，妈的怎么不抓起来这种人。
 那倒也是的 哎
 me too T T
 feel any better??? ^^
跟中岛美嘉也有点像的 
 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
 来吧来吧💃💃💃💃
Everything said on Orange Days is soooooooo true.
All the fans need to chill. It's one loss. It's not end of the world. Come on, we are only half way into the season.
This game was doomed from the very start, really didn't expect our guys to beat them at the first place. 3 key D players are out.
 来啊我收留你

When three of your starters are out, you can't ask for too much.

Geeeeez, now three starters are injured. Just Great!

Football games on Friday? Bad idea! Are you trying to kill the players?
I agree officiating did not cost us the game, but it did contribute to it.
Let's all get on board to kiss Wilson's ass!!! WoooHoooo.
I was fairly calm after the loss.

RT : #49ers TE Vernon Davis to #Seahawks Richard Sherman: "Be humble. Be gracious." Learn to be a gentleman. http://t.co/X6b15iq…
I know Crab is no saint, he probably did do sth to piss She-Man off. But to go off on the camera like that, plain arrogant.
The thought of seeing chickens in the SB make me want to vomit.
RT : #49ers WR  will be training with  in Miami this offseason.
RT : Hey Richard Sherman, thanks for making us all Bronco fans!
That's how fucked up seachickens fans are. I'm not surprised. With that kinda character you get on the field. Huh. Real Classy.
Seriously...seachickens need to stop being bunch of pricks. Be careful with karma bitches! I hope PM kick your sorry asses in SB!
They are still using Justin's ass in the opening...come on.
RT : Seahawks fans threw food at Bowman on his way out.
RT : Raise your hand if you think the refs were out to get me ALL YEAR!!!!!!
RT : Colin Kaepernick all class after his first road playoff loss. 
 Head Up!
RT : Thanks for your support !! #NinerNation
I would not response to that prick honestly. You just lost the game, and you didn't come to play exactly. Just ignore it and keep working.
I hope Peyton beat these chickens' ass in SB. Denver FTW!!!
It hurts like hell when two seasons ended on the exact same play. Fuck. I just can't get over it.
RT : Film don't lie...     pull up the tape of that game and show me where this guy is the best?  #fake #fake #f…
Bowman will recover from this! He is the best! Much respect to him!!!!
We were not even in this game if wasn't for Kap. Quit bashing him.
RT : Thanks for all the love and support. It wasn't in His will. #blessed
RT : It hurts to lose like this. Hard to say.. but they earned it. We'll be back. We win as a team and lose as a team. I lov…
I knew he is going to take all the blame.
RT : Kap: "I didn't play good enough to win. I turned the ball over three times. I cost us that game."
I bet Jim wasn't wearing that $8 khakis tonight.
Well, at least I don't have to be worried about SB. OH BTW, from now on, I'm gonna root hard for Manning and Broncos.
RT : Thank you Faithful for your strong support this season. #StayFaithful 
RT : So Russell is a class act!  Sherman on the other hand....  If he played baseball would get a high and tight fastball.
RT : Jim Harbaugh said preliminary exam shows ACL injury for NaVorro Bowman.
Thank you Niners for a great season.
RT : Hats off to the  on another great season #SFUnite
Refs defeated us not these classless chickens.
RT : Here's hoping Peyton Manning and Wes Welker carve up Richard Sherman.
RT : Great play. Congrats to the Seahawks. I can't stand Richard Sherman though #Idiot
FUUUUUUCK YOU Sherman! You Fucking jerk.
RT : So very sad...but still proud of the team for getting this far

Great game. See you next year!
About damn time you show up Vernon!
There is really not much time left guys. Can we friggin pick it up!?
What the fuck happened????
季后赛客场赢了两场，已经很好了，要你们在这么烦人的西雅图主场赢球，真的太难了。明年再来过吧！
Seriously, a 3-point or a 6-point lead is the same thing for me.
That's the Super Bowl I'm not gonna watch.
I think someone just shot me in the heart. That was harsh.
RT : Have to say that was justice.
RT : Terrible loss for the niners with Bowman going down. Even more terrible officiating this game #unbelievable
RT : Just horrific. Navarro Bowman basically surrendered his leg to hang onto a fumble that doesn't count. NFL should be asham…
RT : Tough injury to watch for one of the best linebackers in the NFL --- NaVarro Bowman.  

Thoughts and prayers to him.
All different kinds of crap put on Niners. To say that this game is unfair is a total understatement.
RT : Bowman made a great play on that and they won't even give them the ball. Crappy call refs and on top of it he gets hurt…
What a fantastic season for Navarro Bowman! To end the season like that is brutal.
RT : Another New Rule: If you recover a fumble it's not recoverable
How could chickens came up with the ball!? Fuck this shit.
Stop showing the replay. That's hard to watch.
Game over.
Kap is fighting really hard.
And of course it's gonna get loud. Doomed. That's what it is.
Rogers. Of course.
How many intentional ground calls are they gonna get away? I really don't get this at all.
Roughing the kicker. What can I say. Refs just don't want us to win.
Davis, You need to wake the fuck up!
That was an intentional grounding.
Just one fucking time, special team. Just one time, can you not mess this up for us???
FUCK, Can you fucking give me break?
I need a fucking replay of that touchdown throw.
RT : Colin Kaepernick WHAT A THROW

Anquan Boldin WHAT A CATCH!!

TOUCHDOWN 49ers. 

Great Great Play.
Fuck Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG...That also gave me a heart attack.
RT : Get  the damn ball! #KeysToVictory #NFCChampionship
We are doomed.
Ok, I know where this is going. Gonna get shut down from now on.
What the fuck is wrong with Frank.
Woooo, someone caught a ball.
Now I get it, 12th man right??? That 12th man is the ref!!!!!
Just saying, if we ended up losing the game. It was not on us. I fucking would blame the refs.
Fuckkkkkk these refs. It's not the game you should determine. Get the fuck out. Let them play.
How many worst calls in NFL history are the refs going to give SF?? Seriously? Did our players kill your family or sth?
RT : Not that it matters, but that PF was one of the worst calls in NFL history. And I never hyperbolize.
RT : That is a horrendous penalty. It takes away any chance of 49ers have of tacking on points at the end of the half.
The officials are trying really hard to help chickens win this game right?
Another fucking stupid penalty? Are you kidding me?
You won't always pull off Johnny Football. That's not gonna happen every fucking time.
Fucking make a play.
If you are going to put this game all on Kap himself....Ugh..
都他妈的是黄油手吗？球你他妈的接不住？
At least one of our receivers need to step the fuck up.
C'mon D!
That was a total let down.
Guess what? We are in the friggin red zone again!
RT : THAT DUDE. 
No matter what, we need to stick with the runnning game. I trust in Gore!
If you called the penalty on Hitner, then how about that hit on LaMichael?
Don't do this shit to me.
What the fuck.
BOWMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He didn't hit him in the head. Bullshit call always goes against us.
The refs just hate Hitner.
Dodged a bullet right there. Not a good coverage. RW just blew a chance.
But a beautiful punt. Haven't seen that in a long time!
That's very frustrating.
We had the game's first 1st down. Is that a good sign??
Well, that's not something new.
RT : NINERS!!!!!!  #GimmeThat #NFCChampionship
Aldon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Careful with the passing game and time management. Let's go!!!
I'm shocked I actually can see some red.
Shit...I hate this feeling...
RT : Pregame huddle. #QuestForSix 
RT : "I’m not worried about adjusting to please someone’s opinion. I’m worried about doing what I have to try &amp; help the team win"…
Seriously, Stop praising him.
RT : Instead of shaking off Alex next year I'm just going to stand on the mound and yell #Omaha
Game over.
Boooo, I just hope our game wouldn't be like this one.
Very good crowd. Quiet when your offense is playing.
I'm trying really hard to avoid the predictions. But they keep popping up.
We've done pretty good this year actually. Two playoffs road win in a row? It's damn good!
The nerve is killing me.
兄弟 你好歹也世界15了 别那么畏畏缩缩的行么
我擦 狐狸你给我闭嘴
好久没看闹闹打球了，几潇洒！
