It was more of a Jimmy thing for me.

This year can't start any worse, I mean seachickens won the Super Bowl.
I want baseball....NOW!
RT : It's pretty obvious the best two teams in the NFL are the Seahawks and the 49ers, and no one else is even close.
RT : Worst Super Bowl ever
RT : Man even the commercials this year are bad. This Super Bowl sucks.
And again, like I said. Defense wins you big game. NFC is too good this year.
This just proved that we were pretty good last week. At least Kap was doing some damages.
RT : Those 17 points the 49ers scored two weeks ago are looking downright extraordinary right now.
Embarrassing
For the guy who broke into my house and robbed us. Hope you have a miserable life. I hope u choke to death.
RT : Great hosting  Chalk Talk with 49ers star quarterback,  ! 
Cheaters don't deserve to win.
Now kick their stupid asses for me, Denver!!!
Wow...finally a win...
Are we really that desperate??? You just fucking signed the guy. What do you expect from him?
Seriously...don't know what the fuck these guys are talking about.
Really nice seat, Kap!!
RT : Backstage at #NFLHonors with Colin Turtlenick....don't let him fool you tho, the speed is REAL!

I'm only watching Nashville for Avery right now.
I don't blame my guys. It's pretty much mission impossible right now.
Someone needs to step the fuck up.
There are ppl stalking Kap in NY!?
You are fucking kidding me right?
 你妈是什么反应？
Guess it's time to panic.
Trying to avoid twitter these days. Never getting good news from here.
I miss the Jimmy in S2. He was the right guy for Fi.
I can't see this team winning any games right now. Need these starters back. And TP needs some rest too. Sth is bothering him!
First time I find an on-screen kiss creep as hell.
Fuck this shit.
 你在这里说话吧，我会看着回的。😘
 做梦吧你在 加上我现在枫叶卡还没补好，哪都没得去。
I saw that one coming though, why cast a hot guy to play Fiona's bf's brother?
I'm speechless after watching the new shameless episode...
我今天听到一件我听过最恐怖的事情，一个男的跟我说他11岁没了贞操，是被他的邻居一个已婚妇女夺走的。在一个停电的晚上把一个11岁大的男孩子勾引去，被玩然后就搞上了。这活生生的一个恋童癖，妈的怎么不抓起来这种人。
 那倒也是的 哎

Everything said on Orange Days is soooooooo true.
All the fans need to chill. It's one loss. It's not end of the world. Come on, we are only half way into the season.
This game was doomed from the very start, really didn't expect our guys to beat them at the first place. 3 key D players are out.
