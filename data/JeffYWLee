Will it be better if nothing ever happened? Not even time can tell.
Been feeling bad for two days on the same thing but for different reasons, first day you were simply mad, second day just want to forget it.
That said, I wish I can still be angry about the same thing. So I can tell myself to let it go.
It's amazing when you were so depressed because of something someone else did, and have a totally different way seeing it few days later.
