虽说是为了柔佛州子民，说穿了还不是为了一个种族而已.
柔佛州从2014年起告别Monday Blue, 迎来全新的Sunday Blue!

The weather is so freaking cold and I just can use SCARY this word to describe it.
I really wonder how I can survive in winter.

Today's Tuesday blue! /__\
Finally I can understand my mum's feeling!
这个家大大小小的事务几乎都是我处理的.
But what I can say?
Sometimes my roommates're useless and never lend me their hands when I really need their help.
原本就只可以专心赶作业.
今天真的很累很累啊.

我是天生的好管家! (Y)
你们就不能主动收拾主动打扫主动把用过的东西放回去? Zz.
真希望我能戒掉那奇葩的强迫症要不然别说我的室友连我自己也会嫌弃我自己.
我生出来就是我室友的奴隶(?)
Especially when u touch other foreign languages.
Seriously ENGLISH is really not so difficult as we think.
连英语都顾不好还去学什么法语. Zz.有时候我还真想干我自己哈哈.
We should be boss for those lecturers as we pay for them.
Btw I still look forward to those societies especially VOLUNTEERING SOCIETY and VETERINARY NURSING.
管它的反正也不会算分.心情好就去应酬下心情不好的时候睬它都傻哈哈.

踏出我的第一步!
Too many societies let me choose! Awwww headache.

In the 1-hour Marketing class, my cute lecturer let us watch a video and I still dunno what the hell the video's talking about in the end..
可惜我一点也不快乐，没有月饼没有提灯笼没有放孔明灯，陪我的只有寂寞空虚还有那该死的爱尔兰专属冷气候! D;
中秋节快乐! :D
I think MARKETING is a big big trouble for me.
FOUNDATION ACCOUNTING is quite boring for me as I had learned most of them before..
I really hope those textbooks are very useful because they're very expensive! Feel like very guilty because I'm wasting my parent's money.):
To all my lovely lecturers,
I hope I can fully use my textbooks which u RECOMMENDED us to buy for my studies, if not I will gonna be crazy!!
干为什么我的course要那么多的课本?!二手书又那么多难找. Zz.
三天没上Twitter突然很想扫扫尘哈哈.

Eating? Workout? Sleeping? Facebook? Playing computer games? Okays TELL ME WHAT ELSE I CAN DO!!!
Sometimes I hate those long term holidays as I think they're useless and wasting my precious lifetime!
