RT : It's sweet when someone knows every single detail about you. Not because you constantly remind them, but because they pay…
RT : I hate when people think I'm in a bad mood just because I'm being quiet.
Just reach home. So tired!

Not worth at all~~
RT : Don't say "sorry" and then do it all over again.
RT : No girl wants to be with a guy that can't let other girls know he's taken.
RT : After someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore.
RT : Never mistake silence for ignorance, calmness for acceptance, or kindness for weakness.
RT : No one notice your tears, No one notice your sadness, No one notice your pains, But they all notice your mistakes.
RT : What you see is not what u think.
RT : The longer the explanation, the bigger the lie.
RT : You seems happier w/o me.
RT : Agree? 
RT : Is it I'm not worth for you to stay?
RT : Love is the most beautiful thing to have, hardest thing to earn and most hurtful thing to lose.
RT : Never forget your friends when you're in a relationship.
RT : Relationships takes TWO people. Not one person being faithful and another acting single.
RT : I am a #Leo because I'm super sweet but fiesty when provoked.
RT : Sometimes, I'm just a simple person who hides a thousand feelings behind the happiest smile.
RT : There is a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Think about that before you judge …
RT : 我相信报应
RT : Truth hurts, lies hurts. Which one will you choose?
RT : Teary eyes...
Dun last seen me! 🙎
RT : Sometimes we expect more from others, because we would be willing to do that much for them.
RT : 当你习惯独自一个人时就没什么好怕了
RT : 你可以不要将8吗 ? 什么事都想知道。人家要给你知道就自然会告诉你, 不必你特地走过来问到底
RT : I may not be the best, but I am definitely not like the rest, I am ME.
RT : The people with the kindest hearts always seem to be the ones who get taken advantage of.
RT : #Leo - Leo women are born to be creative.
So tired...
RT : So true! 
RT : You can copy me but you can never be me.
RT : A #Leo is often a tough but sensitive person.
RT : No girl wants to be with a guy that can't let other girls know he's taken.
RT : #Leo can sometimes come across as indifferent.
RT : She's hurt a lot more than you think.
RT : Next time a stranger talks to me when I'm alone, I will look at them shocked and whisper quietly "You can see me?"
RT : 你累了, 说好的幸福呢?
RT : 不想再理会别人会怎么想, 毕竟从来都没有人懂我.
RT : Realize that I no longer understand people.. I DONT.
Home.
RT : Perhaps, I still expect something. (':
RT : Zzzz
RT : When you are having a bad day, talk to a #Leo. They always have something funny to say that will make you forget your problem…

RT : The walls that I build, is getting higher and higher.
RT : 有些人，有些事，该忘就忘了吧，人家从没把你放心里过，你又何必自作多情。

RT : Be the change you wish to see in the world.
RT : These drinks looks soo good🍹😍 
RT : If a #Leo gives you their trust, do not break it. They will never trust you again.

RT : Sohai.
RT : What is disappointed? Can eat one anot?
RT : does anyone else feel like this sometimes 
RT : The people that swear that they're loyal to you are the ones you really have to watch.
RT : Irresponsible. -.-
Why no rain?
Raining soon?
RT : I need this in my backyard 
RT : One is enough.
RT : Respect me, I respect you. Disrespect me, well then fuck you.
RT : When I'm quiet:

1) tired
2) don't have anything to talk about

Two times! U know! I really can't take it!!==
我恨你! 彻底的恨你!
你赢了~==
RT : I hate that feeling. The feeling when you're sad and you have no idea why, but you just are.
RT : #Leo's are family oriented.
RT : Nobody is ever too busy. If they care, they will make time.
RT : There's no use stressing over something in the past, because there's nothing you can do to change it. Just move on, life …
RT : Hurting someone with the truth is better than making them happy with a lie.
RT : At one point in your life, you either have the things you want or the reasons why you don't.
RT : Success is a journey, not a destination. The process is often more important than the outcome.
RT : Some friends aren't really friends... They're family.
RT : Don't let the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present.
RT : Not important to anyone...
RT : 其实我有好多话想对你说
RT : Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.
RT : 期望越大 失望越大
RT : 真希望奇迹会发生
RT : Best Valentines Gifts! 💍🌹 
RT : If it doesn't matter, don't let it stress you out. Stay happy and focus on what truly does matter.
RT : Dear heart 
RT : Friendship is not only about how much we care when we are together, it's about how much we care when we are apart.
RT : The person you took for granted today, may turn out to be the person you need tomorrow.
RT : Let it go, can't hold back anymore.
RT : Fake smile on the outside, real pain on the inside.
RT : 女人最大的骄傲不是她的长相有多出众，而是她的男人有多疼她。
RT : 其实总是笑的人，真的很需要人疼。
RT : Yep. 
RT : #Leo's are very tolerant. You can do a lot of bad things and they'll forgive you but they will never forget.
RT : Single doesn't always mean lonely and relationship doesn't always mean happy.
RT : True 
RT : What a #Leo wants, a Leo gets.
Will my prediction accurate? Lets see~
Disappointed.
Is not easy to let go something. If it is, it mean u didn't treat it seriously.
RT : tbh reasons why I'm scared of relationships. 
Wondering uh..
RT : I don't know why. I AM ALWAYS TIRED.
RT @Notfunnyeh_: Her smile may be a desperate cry for help .
RT : I'm rdy~ 😂 
RT : Don't play with someone's heart if you have no intentions for a serious relationship.
RT : Sometimes what I need to stop all my paranoid thinking is just an assurance that I'm not irritating to anybody.
RT : What for care so much? They don't even care.
RT : If I know that it will be so hurtful, I wouldn't have create so much memories.
RT : no one in the world is zhen xin de ..
RT : It hurts ..
你是故意的 对吧?
RT : 我只是希望你在身边而已...
RT : If it's meant to be, it will be, don't force it.
RT : I thought you care, yes I thought.
RT : A simple "I miss you" message means everything.
RT : I miss how tight you hold my hand when we walk along the street.
RT : Love is missing someone whenever you're apart but somehow feeling warm inside because you're close in heart.
RT : Mirror house 
Alright.
RT : Being there for people, because you know what it's like to have no one there for you.
RT : The truth 
RT : The older I get, the less people I trust.
RT : #Leo's are always there to listen, they are always understanding.
RT : 爱情，是一种距离，比宇宙年漫长，比光年遥远。我忘不掉你，可是，我不会再见你。
RT : Love is the sadness of being too far away.
What am I waiting for...?
RT : That scary moment when you are about to sleep and horror scenes flash in your mind.
Can't describe what I feel now...
RT : Sometimes, I just don't get it why you can talk to everybody so well but yet you are ignoring me.
RT : Be strong now. Things will get better.
RT : This is what it actually means.. 
Keep caughing...
RT : I want our relationship to be like Tom and Jerry. No matter how many times we fight, we won't be apart.
RT : 已發生的事無法改變。
RT : 真真假假，沒人知道。:/

Leg pain==
RT : If two people are happy together... leave them alone.
RT : That awesome moment when someone is lying, and you know the truth.
RT : 是我的心太复杂了

RT : I hate being tickled. I do not think it's cute, I do not think it's funny, I will kick you in the fucking face.
RT : I believe in hate at first sight.
Can't trust ur words. Yes u!
Can't believe uh...
What can I say now? ==
RT : Treat people how you would want to be treated? Nah, Treat people how they treat you.
RT : #Leo hold a lot in until you strike that last nerve.

RT : Because #Leo fears the loss of independence, they have hard time settling down.
RT : Don’t say, just show. Don’t talk, just act. Don’t promise, just prove.
RT : A real boyfriend is scared of losing his girl. 💯
RT : One mistake and everyone judges you.
RT : 我的爱跟别人一样, 你却舍得让我受伤.
It's just a bad day, not a bad life :)
RT : Don't play with her feelings, bro.
RT : 11:11 开心就好
