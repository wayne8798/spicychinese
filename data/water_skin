RT : Smiling is the best way to face every problem for a #Leo
RT : Don't fall in #love. 
RT : 爱情有两种：一种是你想牵他手，在街上、超市里走。你们做爱、做饭。你们看电视给对方夹菜。你们在一起，像头驴子，转啊转，把时间磨成粉末，然后用粉末揉面，做包子饺子面条，吃下去心满意足。还有一种，是远远地，用一点微弱的想象,给这暗下去的岁月，涂一抹口红。

RT : 我就是一瞬间想通了 释然了 在下一秒又想不通了 每天都在这样不停的循环中
RT : 想你，但不打扰，静静的思念就好，把最后一点尊严留给自己。
RT : Whatever, i dont give a damn
RT : 几年后也许我会忘了现在所放不下的.
