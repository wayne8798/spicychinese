有些男人愛妳，是想跟妳過一輩子。有些男人愛妳，只想和妳過一陣子。過一輩子的男人愛妳不會很用力，因為他要把力氣放在生活上。過一陣子的男人必會愛妳愛的死去活來，因為他只需要愛過妳、睡過妳和拋棄過妳就可以。所以好男人照顧妳的生活，壞男人照顧妳的感情。

I still believe in love
Love does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.It always protects,always trusts,always hopes, always perseveres.Love never fails.
