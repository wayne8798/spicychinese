RT : That's me: 
You're all I want,  You're all I need,  You're everything, everything.
You calm the storms,  And you give me rest.  You hold me in your hands,  You won't let me fall.
I want to feel you,  I need to hear you.  You are the light,  That's leading me,  To the place,  Where I find peace again.

So I'm not moving
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
