鄺導同我地檢討先前練習既錄影，其一絲不苟令我團非常佩服及感激！ 
全能的facebook, 有冇人3月1日全日(9pm-11pm)得閒? 摘聲需要多一名ASM負責安排及搬少量props。幫手者可以免費(於後台)睇我地場show及貼身經歷本組合rehearsal實況!! 有意者請inbox我地, 有有關經驗者優先 :)
摘聲3月1日音樂會既場地「香港兆基創意書院 - 文化藝術中心」一直致力促進香港既藝術發展。大家可以到依度睇下佢地有關我地音樂會既介紹，順便睇下其他多元既活動！...

摘聲今次搵黎名導Gladys同我地排戲，多謝佢無私既幫忙，令我地對3月1日既concert好有信心！！

農曆新年假期，我哋除咗拜年之外，仲努力為3月1號嘅音樂會練習！不過過年就梗係唔少得食啦 :)
仲未向我哋嘅團員留飛的話，就記得快啲搵我哋啦！

仲有5個星期就係摘聲嘅音樂會啦，係時候溫下書！(笑)
呢個係兩年前我哋在山頂廣場的演出，希望大家喜歡！
