我真希望我现在听到的都不是真的!!! 可是现在不管是不是真的 我也不会再相信你了!!! 因为你说的话已经不值得我去相信了!!!
你真的让我感到非常的失望。。。失望! 失望!!
我真的明白了! 什么是日久见人心!!
我从头到尾 都相信你不会这样做 可是!! 你却做了
那以候你要我怎么相信你!!!! 你说!!!
我还以为你不会和别人一样可是 现在我觉得你和她们都一样没什么分别!!!
难道就像每个人说的, 每当一个人有了另一个半 那个人都会为他们的另一个半变吗!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

RT : 最好的朋友，平时互相调侃，是嘴最狠的那个。在你需要的时候，却是心最软的那个。
喜欢一个人安静不需要安慰，喜欢一个人站在窗边望着远处发呆，喜欢一个人毫无目的的走着。一个人哭泣、一个人难过、一个人分担。一个人，走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌。看到视线由模糊到清晰，清晰后模糊，反复不停。终于明白原来我们都是爱寂寞的人。"
