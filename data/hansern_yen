我已经尽量成为每个女生梦中的男生啊，难道这样都有错? 还是我太过高估自己?
天啊，这是什么道理呀
我也没力气了
女生每次埋怨男生不够爱她们，可是现在太过爱她也有错。可能之前太过宠你了吧，现在变成得寸进尺
Fuck love haha
两个人真心相爱，他们不是只是要对方meh? 还有其它东西的啊? Lol
 我努力了那么多次，为什么这次不是她呢? 我给不到她想要的东西
若是真心相爱，这些只是芝麻绿豆而已..
是啊，我给不到你想要的东西，可是你有没有站在我这一边想过?
不会珍惜
已经尽力给你我说拥有的一切, 可是你要更多。这样无论我给多少你永远都不会足够
然后这样就没了.. 可惜..
想要复合可是又不会暗示好来..然后觉得失望了就说我不懂她要的是什么..女人..
Yeah I'm not a good boyfriend lol sorry
