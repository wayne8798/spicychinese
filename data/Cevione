男人不该让女人流泪
RT  #Pisces like attention but it only matters when it is coming from the right person.
Why so cute 😍
I'm at Far East Plaza w/ @n0mis3ry 
Fuckery fuck. Snatch cab

I cried but don't know because I'm feeling too blessed or too sad for being ignored always.

RT  Don't step over the line
Thoughts are one that kills you softly deep inside
Because all along, it's all my wishful thinking.
RT  I push you away, just to see whether would you come back.
One day I'll definitely do the same
RT  You thought you know everything. You judge with your eyes.
RT  The tiredness in me is just unexplainable.
This is too absurd.
This is terrible.
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
RT : I remember back when you’re here with me
RT : #Pisces wants to get close but is constantly confused and rebuffed by struggle to free itself of the heavy emotional deman…
fffff, having headache now. wthhhhh
RT : “: Texting 
the 
same 
person 
all 
day 
and 
night 
and 
never 
getting 
bored 
because 
you 
like 
them 
that …
SOOOOOOOOO TIRED
LOST IT ALL
Goodnight x
RT  RT  如果时间可以重来，那有多好。
It's hard to please everyone
RT  People tries once, twice and then they gives up after awhile
RT  “: 怎么对我，我👌。但是我绝对不容许你伤到我爱的人。”
RT  I wish to be happier, to be carefree. To love with no boundaries, to be loved faithfully.
RT  #Pisces can seem so easy going you almost think they are a pushover. But that's where you are wrong.
Got a super big advanced birthday surprise from my dearest lesbo  today. 😂😅😄 Thankiew, love you to moon &amp; back bey! ♥😍😘  
Oh well, am sorry. 😊 RT  Once a #Pisces has finally deleted you from their memory there isnt any undo button that can fix that.
RT  U called me ur princess, but the fact is I had alr made u my king 💜👑
I'm at GF+A Global Pte Ltd (Singapore)

为何 // 如此
RT  RT  After someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore.
RT  I just want to talk to you despite being very tired. That's all.
What's with waking up to an itchy eye
RT  don't talk to me only when you're lonely
RT  家家有本难念的经
RT  Being and staying IN love with you, are the most beautiful moments of my life.
RT  In a moment you can turn a life around // Forever to be found in you
RT  Forever &amp; Always.
RT  don't come to me when you're lonely
RT : #Pisces tend to be more concerned with other peoples problems then their own. Not because they are nosy, but because they …

So different. Wtf, am like "SERIOUSLY? ".... Hello at least got some manners and smile back la. Wts
Doesn't seems right, what's wrong?
A total failure.
Stabbing again and again.
Kill myself
Leading to the disappointments
Unappreciative. Not happy
Not even contented
RT  Some best friends are meant to stay nothing but best friends.
RT  If this is how boys are gonna love girls, don't even. This is not love this is tearing her soul apart.
Where got such people one
Walao very headache eh. Idk which venue to choose?
Why. 
RT : Don't take someone for granted just because everytime you push them away, they always come running back to you. Because one…
"Expectation is the root of all heartache. " - William Shakespeare
Hate this feeling, I just hate myself.
I got no time to entertain people like you. Only find people when you needs something, if not just ignore and forget that person's existence
RT  So tired of being tired
I hope I meant something to you @ Cee's ; 💟 
Live as if you'll die tomorrow, Dream as if you'll live forever.
Because you make me believe.
选择
RT  “: 我不指望什么 , 也不奢求 .”
RT  Even when I confront, you would still deny.

SMILE 😁 @ Zouk 
RT  RT : Sometimes i just dont feel like talking
RT  I. Just. Wanna. Run. Back. Into. Your. Arms
RT  Even when sad, a #Pisces has a funny, cute face that makes it hard to tell if they really are sad and depressed.
": The ride that you won't forget :: The Dodonpa, Japan "
": That's the true happiness of being blissful. It's not just on special occasions."

Damn sissy
Gu niang, 1 year passed but still wanna bicker about it.
I'm not like you dude
Haters hate, potatoes potate.
You don't like me, you don't have to be a two faced idiot.
RT  Be happy. Be yourself. If others don’t like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn’t about pleasing everybody.
