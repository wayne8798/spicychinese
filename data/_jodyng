台湾偶像剧根本就是冲着看偶像而看的。剧情根本就很洒狗血。
我羡慕你的勇气。
Most of the time I'm just finding excuses cos I'm lazy. I actually love reading.
I actually doesnt like e-books. I still prefer holding to a book and read it while having a cup of coffee or tea :3
Finally I can get rid of reading my favorite novel on my phone. Damn annoying -_-
but hor if i read all the three books first then kan I will know what happen on the 3rd installment of the movie? HMM DILEMMA.
i literally think the best thing in life now is that I received my parcel within 24 hours XD
Finally upgraded my phone to kitkat. Hahaha
Most probably I'll get feedback like "wasting money" or "are you mad?!" or "not worth at all". but who cares. I like it and that's all.
这份我拷赏自己的礼物就当着是告诉自己上学期做得很好，下学期继续加油!
You must believe that there's someone who loves you in this world. 
He will definitely find you.

原来友情那么脆弱。
眼泪流干了，然候呢? 地球依然在转，生活依然要过。
人都是自私的。在你觉得你在一件事上是受伤最重的人的时候，总是会有一个人永远是最大的受害者，可是你却无法谅解他的悲伤。
再多的眼泪也换不回一颗完整的心。
 LOLOLOL like that also excited

最痛苦的莫过于当个最熟悉的陌生人。
Everytime I watch a drama I'll always begin to pity the character that I dislike from the beginning.
 hahaha I'm always a fan of sg dramas xD
