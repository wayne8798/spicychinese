Np#修炼爱情
RT : You have no idea how much l like you. How much you make me smile, how much l love talking to you, or how much l wish you …

Bored
": I seriously can't stop thinking about you."
RT : RT 我没穿过情侣装,没和喜欢的人放过礼花,在一起都没超过一年,没人管的了我,没人说离开我活不了,没人失去我好像失去全世界,没做过让人羡慕的事情,没人做过感动让我流眼泪的事情,没人在一句我难受的时候说一句你在哪马上到,没人在误会我的时 候为我说…
Np# do what you want

Tears
RT : A boyfriend should always send you a good morning &amp; good night text even if you don't talk all day just to let you know y…
Note 3 :DDDD
RT : A morning text doesn't only mean "good morning", but it also means "you're the first thing on my mind when I wake up."
忽冷忽热
Bai nian
RT : I may not be your first love, first kiss, first sight or first date. I just want to be your last everything.
RT : Honestly, you're all I think about. 💭👌💕
RT : Everyday I wake up and the first thing I think about is YOU, then after that I go through a whole entire day just thinking…
RT : The hardest thing is not talking to someone you used to talk to everyday.
RT : I love everything about you.
RT : 总是在想各种各样的方式来逗你开心，但到最后你还不是我的。
RT : I'm still in love with you.
Deng dai
RT : I want someone who will stay with me no matter how hard I am to be with.
      Happy Chinese New year too:3
RT : You're sad? I'll cheer you up. You're upset? I'd love to listen. All you have to do is come to me, you know I'll be there…
RT : Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but s…
RT : I know everything happens for a reason. But sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.
Gong xi fa cai, ang pau na lai :B
Lou sang :3
RT : Yes, I'm thinking about you right now.
 举起手,唱啦啦啦啦
RT : Sometimes I just wish you were here so I could tell you how much I need you and how hard everyday has been without you.
Moody
RT : Fast replies make me feel like you actually want to talk to me. But slow replies make me think you're talking to someone …
 bojio:(
RT : You have no idea how much l like you. How much you make me smile, how much l love talking to you, or how much l wish you we…
RT : Yep 😍😘 
RT : 你永远也看不见我最寂寞的时候，因为我只有在你看不见我的时候最寂寞。
RT : 我用力地看着你，却在你的眼中看到别人的影子。
RT : 思念一个人的滋味，就象是喝了一杯冰冷的水，然后一滴一滴凝成热泪。
RT : 只要爱一个人，那么就会心甘情愿为他而改变。如果一个人在你面前我行素，置你不喜欢的行为而不顾，就是不爱你。所以如果你不够关心他或是他不够关心你，那么你就不爱他或他不爱你。
": 喜欢一个人，是不会有痛苦的。爱一个人，也许有绵长的痛苦，但他给我的快乐，也是世上最大的快乐。"
RT : Stop trying so hard for people who aren't even worth your time.
Sigh
How long i can wait
RT : Always.. 
 byebye
RT : 其实越好的人 越不会被珍惜的
Be true, be real :)
RT : To be honest.. 😢💔 
RT : Talking to you makes my day.
RT : I know I may not always show it, but you really do mean a lot to me. ♥
RT : You're sad? I'll cheer you up. You're upset? I'd love to listen. All you have to do is come to me, you know I'll be there…
RT : Can't stop thinking about you.
RT : I'm single but I know who I want.
RT : Once I care about you, I will never stop.
RT : I will always care for you, even if we are not together and even if we are far away from each other.
RT : If you need me, call me.

I don't care if I'm: 
- sleeping
- having my own problems
- angry with you.

I'll be there for …
RT : I miss you so much.
RT : You're still the first person I think of when I wake up.
RT : 有些话, 是为了你而说的。有些事, 是为了你而做的。有些快乐, 是为了你才装的。有些心痛, 是为了你才藏的。
我明白了
RT : Even if I had a million reasons to leave you, I would still look for one to stay.
RT : Saying "I'm fine" when you're not, 
"it's nothing" when it's everything, 
"I'm done" when you know you still wanna try.
RT : The more you care, the more it hurts.
RT : I really wish.. 💗 
RT : Stop worrying about people that aren't worried about you.
RT : 我错过一次 不想再错过第二次
RT : Right person, wrong time. I hate that.
": I just wish you knew what I feel about you. That's it."
RT : Every time I look at you, it's like I'm falling for you all over again.
": The hardest decision is deciding whether to "walk away" or "try harder.""
IMY
RT : Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but…
RT : As long as you're still the same person I fell for, my feelings won't ever change.
RT : Sometimes all you need, is someone who can make you smile.
RT : 你不知道，我的心情一直被你左右。有时候，躲避是为了让自己不那么失望。
RT : I want you to miss me. I want you to care. I want you to text me first.
RT : Just remember, I was there when no one else was.
Bored ~,~ 
RT : You're different and I like different.
RT : I wish you could understand the way I feel about you.
RT : 可以影响你心情的人，在你心里一定很重要吧。
RT : 你是否也曾这样，心里很想和某个人聊天，却希望他先来找你， 呆呆的看着他的头像一遍又一遍。
是我太天真了
RT : I care too much. That's how I get hurt
RT : 怎样才算是爱？ — 当你发现那个人在你心里有很大的位置时，你就懂什么叫爱了 :) 
": Trust no one, fear nothing, and have no regrets."
RT : I admit, I have trust issues.
RT : Can you please be mine already?
RT : Come here, I miss you.
RT : Hardest thing in life, letting go of what you thought was real.
Sigh
RT : I wish I could be every little thing you wanted all the time.
": I don't want perfect, I want honest."
RT : Match her effort 👌 
Respect her hustle 💰 
Support her ambition 💃 
Protect her heart 💖 
Value her loyalty 🙌 
Uplift her …
RT : You're so special to me and I can't even explain why.
RT : I'll hold you in my heart, till I can hold you in my arms.
RT : I miss you as soon as you leave.
RT : I miss you, text me.

 what so funny o
RT : Just because I don't talk to you, or text you first, doesn't mean I don't miss you. I'm just waiting for you to miss me.
RT : I automatically smile when i see you.
RT : You texting me first = A big smile on my face.
RT : True love don't come when you're searching for it, true love just come only to a patient heart.
RT : Start every day with a new hope, leave bad memories behind and have faith for a better tomorrow.
RT : No words can fully describe all the feelings I have for you.
I want go backkkkkkk
Tired

RT : The worst feeling ever is not knowing whether you should wait or give up...
RT : I really like you. A lot. I know sometimes I mess up and do things that make it seem like I don't care but trust me, you'…
说不出
RT : I was there for you, remember that.
RT : I’ll never be perfect, you just have to accept the fact that I am who I am.
RT : Good times come and go, but the memories stay forever.
