 本土劇廢話好多喔
 是喔！我也要看哈哈哈。我看到說什麼濕身告白的。一定很好笑拉右是台語劇我也去看哈哈哈
 「世間情」。我沒看，是新聞報導的哈哈哈極力撇清。在歐美劇女女橋段見怪不怪了，台灣鄉土劇還是頭一次出現阿！
連本土劇都在搞什麼小三愛上元配的女女戀劇情是怎樣
在遊戲中殺人殺到頭暈所以連作夢都在殺人
This is a successful work. A masterpiece. There r so many places and house I didn't even explore during my first playthrough lol
There are multiple outcomes in a single chapter, single playthrough. Characters act differently depend on the player's behavior
I've never been to the second playthrough in a game. Never. But Dishonored has an exception. This game wins my heart.
 I think I've heard it, but I haven't watched it!
Holly:".... it turns out I don't like men.", Gail: "Me too.", Holly:" I mean I'm a lesbian.", Gail:" Ah, I mean I hate people." LOL
I watched a couple of lesbian scenes of a Canadian TV series called Rookie Blue, some lines are funny
He got boiled to death. This is sick 😱
I can't stop my killing spree, I just neutralized my target, and carried him to Steam Room in the whore house, I turned on the valve...
Going through my high chaos walkthrough in #Dishonored. I killed tons of guards, bodies and rats everywhere, my sword was full of blood
My friend is coming back from Canada on Tuesday, I'm so excited
 sorry to hear that! :( Cheer up. Hope u r ok :)
RT : Which are you?.. 
  haha funny!
I like Daud more than Corvo lol!
Awesome  via @youtube
The only news I wanna see about you is your "tragic" death. Lol
@ComeStayOut only pornstars or prostitutes will be attracted by him!!! Bc he has lots of $$$$&amp;. If he's poor, who cares about him? Hahaha
@ComeStayOut hahahahaha 我有稍微看那推文，根本沒耐心看完。講一堆費話誰在呼阿。白癡。哈哈
And I see many people say they wish GOD took you instead than Paul Walker hahaha.
@ComeStayOut 一堆人罵死老頭
Only people live in America can shop on Amazon? Not fair! Lol
I need that Dishonored lamp USB! I just ordered it from Amazon. Lol! I'm glad my cousin lives in USA...
Stay away from those tabloids. We don't wanna see IT. Why do media always love junk?
@ComeStayOut 他們罵她啥？哈哈
RT @ComeStayOut: 看新女寵被罵好爽！至少天使沒跟她一樣笨！stay out of it. his ex wife and kids.it's the only smart thing in that relationship.
A 48 year-old man has a 13 year-old mind. What a pathetic thing. He doesn't deserve those beautiful kids.
@ComeStayOut yes!!! Fuck that old jerk!!! He is definitely a PIG!! Worse than pigs. Pigs are cuter than him
RT @ComeStayOut: if she is A pig, then, what are you? i don't even have to think about it. BC  you are nothing.
So beautiful!!! 
@ComeStayOut 我有看瞞天大佈局很好看，我媽說整部電影就珍妮佛最會演哈哈
@ComeStayOut Jennifer Laurence? lol
 lol
@ComeStayOut 女人笨！招式遜！沒創意，他沒梗了阿，所以只能重複使用了。
Always the same pattern. Such a fool. LOL. Can't wait to see the ending of this stupid drama. Such a entertainment hahaha
@ComeStayOut 我有時會去看那寵物的推特笑死我了，每天沈浸在與老頭的愛裡。好多人回她說死老頭之前也對某人講過一樣的話。哈哈哈。刺青、花、卡坡，手錶、老頭也帶她去冰島，還是一模一樣的地方哈哈哈
好想再去紐約
 哈哈哈哈哈哈
 幾度阿？
Just watched Contracted. Oh so gross! LOL! Remember to use protection while having sex. It's what this movie wanna tell us.
每天去看那兩隻貓都讓我好開心，她們快一歲了
 哈哈哈
I liked  in About Cherry.
I liked her when I was in junior high school. Lol! Too bad, she's still not famous enough.
Watched Compulsion today. It was a weird movie... I don't think Heather Graham gets old! She looks so young. She's like 44 years old now?
Just posted a video 
 Can't wait to watch Season 4 ep 8! :)
RT : For more behind the scenes of #LostGirl's next episode, be sure to check my Instagram throughout the week: rachieskarst…

A new renaissance by Dave Hewson:  via @youtube
Cousin told me Left 4 Dead 2 is free now on Steam. Of course I got it now. Who can refuse something free? lol

 Thank you. You too! Merry Christmas :)
 haha thank you! You too! Merry Christmas!
The inventor of AK-47 died. 94 years old!
Still enjoy Lost Girl. Just watched S4E5. I love Tamsin! And Bo &amp; Lauren back together again. Lol
自從去年辭職後就沒哭過了
找不到適合自己的工作讓我突然覺得很想死，好像自己能力真的很差
RT : made of enjoying being alone.
 me too! Being alone is awesome lol
@ComeStayOut 有阿。爛渣有病一直威脅人。它新智年齡大概只有15歲吧！！
@ComeStayOut 人家丹妮絲是不想自己的小孩和三流女星沾上邊吧！現在我對pstar印象比以前差了
@ComeStayOut 丹妮絲人太好了。對爛渣那麼好，爛渣竟然還想告她有病耶。天使出現我都沒以前興奮了，沒啥感覺，沒想到我也會有不愛的一天。醬也好，我才不想像獨要一樣列哈哈
Love those kids :) 
 @ComeStayOut you both forgot about the chef as well!
 @ComeStayOut and Ireland with Slash as well. And the new commercial about cars. Ah... That song was really bad!
@ComeStayOut just read news about the new pet hates the old man's ex wife. She tried to ruin their friendship. Lol.
 @ComeStayOut lol!!!!!
@ComeStayOut hahahahaha!! The ending is near. That douche is so pathetic. He'd rather hang out with these trash than his children #SMH
"Only bad guys listen to Dubstep" LOL!! #FarCry3 
One of the best game!  via @youtube
@ComeStayOut 哈哈哈哈哈風女二人組。嘿人跟本不想禮他們了吧！獨要好可怕。活再換想禮。天使才不再呼他。我對天使已沒感覺了...
@ComeStayOut 讀要已經到了病態的地步了吧。還有人說支持牠... 他就越得意好可怕啊！！！
巴庸好可愛 
@ComeStayOut 擬無聊的話去看讀要的推。狠跨張！！
 I'm don't great! And you? Long time no talk! Haha
I can't see his neck. Hahaha 
Someone said this cat is pregnant, but it's actually a "he", and he is just fat! Lol 
German grammar is strange! I kinda think this language is harder than French. I think sometimes, I speak German with a French accent
I love Conan O'Brian's Clueless Gamer!!!! Hahaha I can't stop laughing, esp when he was playing Tomb Raider and GTA 5 lol
@ComeStayOut 讀要和嘿人槓上咧。嘿人嗆說它不會迷戀不再呼自己的人。讀要說她不會跟人講一堆天史私下的事。她是最忠新的粉思。天阿哈哈哈
@ComeStayOut what wants JB!!!!!! I want Paul Walker!! Always! Hope that tragedy didn't happen :(
高寶書版請我去面試，下禮拜二，希望這次會成功啊！！
Hate to see something I bought have a discount again! 75% now! I bought it by 50%. lol
The old man is so pathetic. What a joke hahaha
 yes!!! He didn't even get old. He looked always the same. Doesn't look like he was 40 already
I always thought that Paul Walker was only 28. Probably it's bc the first time I've seen him, he was 28. I feel old now. lol
 lol!!!! I laughed.
 每次有名人過世，都有人會說那老頭怎麼還不死。哈哈哈。打不死的蟑螂啊。吸毒吸那麼久還活著，上帝只想把好人帶走... 哭哭！！
@ComeStayOut I didn't see it....
@ComeStayOut add me again!! I got a new phone, so my old line profile got deleted. Lol.
 @ComeStayOut 我對她已經沒興趣三個月瞜。獨要還在迷真厲害
iPhone 5S is so thin
@ComeStayOut 那女的拍過男女耶。我現在一想到pstar就反胃... 不喜歡
@ComeStayOut 我知道阿！超噁！那些女的都是可拋式的物品
I just wish Paul Walker's death is not real. Why do good people always die young? And someone is still sitting there?
 為什麼不是老頭死。哎該死的都不死。話說我看到新聞老頭又換寵物了真噁阿。也是拍那種片的
 L.A.Noire, I'm playing in PC :)
This smart cat always notices which car just parked, so she can sit on it, bc the car is still warm 
The Hollywood sign in 1947 was still Hollywoodland, I can see it in the game!
 I asked those clerks, they said they don't have that dog ring! Sorry :(
 
 對阿！雖然不是到超迷他，但還是蠻難過的，因為我蠻喜歡看他的。真是太突然了...
 :( I'm so sad about this too
It's life... He was alive 24 hours ago. Tragic...
Still sad about Paul Walker's death, although I'm not a die hard fan of his, but still feel bad. I really liked him tho. :(
還是那句話 好人不長命 禍害遺千年
Why... RIP... #PaulWalker I liked him...
Oh no!!!! Paul Walker!!! :((((((
Everyone keeps mentioning Adèle Exarchopoulos in La Vie d'Adèle, but I like Léa Seydoux more haha
The studio that made this game is the one that made GTA series... I still like Hitman: Absolution more
My cousin sent me Max Payne 3 as a thanksgiving gift, lol! Currently playing it, but I'm getting tired of it already lol
RT : Write up I did about Adele Exarchopoulos and her performance in "blue is the warmest color" for Variety.  http://t.co/j…
Cousin fights Jeffrey in Borderlands 2. Hahaha #GameOfThrones #Borderlands2 
Just had the most "ordinary" bday ever. Steam should send me some free games... But not the suck ones! Just saying
I just wish Megan Reed could shut up and let me read everything I want #deusex
 lol I have it downloaded. If u can't find it online, I can give it to u. 風行網沒有，所以我才下載的
I just wasted 90 minutes of my entire life for watching a totally shit movie...
 it's a document. Written by Americans. About eminent domaine in New York lol
 阿樵叫你也看女子監獄啦很好看哈哈哈
表哥說他討厭Piper（戲裡戲外都討厭），但喜歡Alex哈哈哈。#orangeisthenewblack
@ComeStayOut yeah... U r right! 可憐哪
 lol!!!!!
 lol I think it's a metaphor, I can only guess its meaning
Hey, does any English speakers know what "a condemnor can condemn a kasha knish" mean?
Watch Dogs!!!! I want it! So tempting...
亞當降落的姿勢好帥！真希望我也有這個裝備，以後就不用走樓梯了
Gute Nacht
Adam Jensen is so hot 😍 
Love it  via @youtube
I made Adam Jensen a very good man. Except for the bad guy. 
Guten Abend! I know how to speak German now
I'm addicted to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I didn't kill anyone except in the boss fight. I love peace this time
 It's been 3 months... Welcome back ;)
They are going to make a movie about this game, who is gonna play Adam Jensen? 
@ComeStayOut 他們的對白超多黑話和俚語，對我來說有時就算有英文字幕我也不太懂意思，也懶得去查。哈哈反正不影響我對劇情的瞭解就好。好像有比較低清版，要我找給你嗎？你有在用BT下載嗎？
I'm wondering how those 2 kitties in my hometown doing. They grow bigger I think. Hope they still recognize me
And also, I finally bought Dishonored Game of The Year Edition, it's a great game, the graphics are awesome.
Cousin said if I finished Dead Island, he will send me the code of Deus Ex. And I finally finished the entire main campaign of DI yesterday
I'm so happy that my German class starts this Friday
It's not a "hey buy me something" list...
To me, a wish list is just a place I put something I wanna buy. It's actually a "save it for later" list
@ComeStayOut 你只要字幕嗎?  我英文字幕在這抓的
@ComeStayOut 我用BT下載的耶 字幕我是另外抓的 再遷入檔案裡我下高清版 整季共24G
Reading the story of a paralyzed cat made me almost cried. Poor thing. But she wanna live, she never gives up on living

Dishonored and Deus Ex are in my Steam wish list now. I'm waiting for a discount price every day
 I didn't know u keep updating your wishlist.
I never follow any traffic rules in Sleeping Dog. And I just killed people with a fish
@ComeStayOut 對阿！！還有Alex恐嚇瘋女人那段也很酷哈哈哈。瘋女後來說：「你會下地獄」A說：「我已經在那了」哈哈
@ComeStayOut Larry還要求見Alex。他叫她離P遠一點，A說她們在教堂做哈哈哈，但Larry還是離開P了。最後一集演到P終於崩潰失控了！她跟Pennstucky打起來
@ComeStayOut 有人寫網誌介紹，說A其實很癡情。她一直愛著P。但P也有點bitch，在獄中寂寞有＂需要＂才會一直找A，雖然她也愛A。後來P選擇嫁人，A超生氣，叫P再也不要去找她了。我看的都沒剪哈哈。大陸沒辦法，都會管
@ComeStayOut 我也喜歡Nicky！她很好笑哈哈。洗衣機的也很好笑
@ComeStayOut 她也有參與編劇。這是根據她2010年的同名自傳改編。A戲外是金髮有俄國血統。哈哈。她聲音很有磁性。我喜歡Larry打電話時，問Piper：「你愛她嗎？」P哭著說：「愛」哈哈。還有教堂那段。你看的片段有演她為何被單獨監禁嗎？
@ComeStayOut 我看完整版，我下載超久，找不到中文字幕，只好找英文的。這是真實故事喔。作者叫Piper Kerman，她坐過15個月牢，原因跟劇中一樣，只不過她前女友不叫Alex哈哈。她現在結婚了，丈夫真的叫Larry
Love this part. lol  via @youtube
@ComeStayOut 你也有看女子監獄吼？我昨天看完了好好看，你最喜歡誰？我喜歡Alex哈哈，雖然我覺得其實她蠻自私的哈哈，戲裡拉
I don't know my birthday is coming soon. Whatever. It's not important at all. Lol
Just saw two cats fight on a tree. They fight every nights! Now I know where these sounds of cats come from every night
 hahaha true
My love 
Emma Stone 
聽說陳冠希也有在Sleeping Dogs配音
Emma Stone and Lucy Liu really dubbed for Sleeping Dogs! I recognize their voices
Finally get to play Sleeping Dogs, some people said this one is Hong Kong version of GTA. Lol
 just one or two episodes... It's what Internet said! :( I hope she's coming back for more eps :)
I liked her and Piper's on and off relationship... Alex is the coolest of the show
Just realized there is no more Alex Vause in Orange Is The New Black season 2... I feel so sad!!! :(
My Czech class got canceled... So I signed up for German class! I'm learning German!
But my thought is, if I could go to Australia, I will def go. lol
They will pay everything... I said I will think about it
