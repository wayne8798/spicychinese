  i already consider he is. No matter he is alive, dead, playing or retire...
  nvr updated... haha by the way, kobe is a legend. Must respect !!
  zzzz. I seem already know who is it. But lakers fans still think that kobe will win a ring b4 he retire.
  i agree with that, but there is still alot of his fans.
  kobe is lakers trademark nowadays
  for me...lakers signed kobe just for business use.
  they can't even in with kobe. Their players all with injuries.
  i expected this one. They will nvr let go kobe.
 still no confirm de gua.
 okkie, wait ba~
 then mine will also work perfectly. :)
 don't la. If he going to lakers, Timberwolf will lose a great player. Lakers all injure one...
 if thats the reason i pretty sure that your phone will do the same. ( I think so)
