 ah okay couldn't tell. Thats pretty awesome. Didn't think that was french fries and calamaries. haha
 haha ikr. i've seen almost every country received their uniforms from some company.. did the #ROC gov don't care about Taiwanese?
   CKS said to US, no, we are Chinese, we are rightful gov of China, no. And Taiwanese suffer since
   at one pt, US told CKS look, we gotta recog PRC, go change your name to Taiwan, keep UN seat etc
   this could've been prevented if CKS wasn't so stubborn and thought he could still go back to China
   that is correct. You can't have any type of national flag on the uniforms. Its the compromise.
