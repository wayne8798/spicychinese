Never try to overcome your obstacles by yourself, because they are made to be bigger than you so you can learn to lean on God.
Christ is enough. For whatever that comes my way, I will trust in You.

What sacrifice is greater than what's being done 2000 years ago on the cross.. Feeling thankful :')
Sometimes it can feel really bitter by not feeling appreciated by what you had sacrificed.. But then God showed me His Cross.
RT : Don’t compare your situation to somebody else’s. You’re not running their race. You’re running your own race.
RT : Nothing that’s happened in your past has to keep you from your destiny. Prove it wrong by moving forward with your life.
" is made out of a bunch of tough people" couldn't agree more. :')
   hahaha love that epic moment!
And so everytime I try to rush into a train that is closing I will think about  😂  
Emmanuel. He's with me through my greatest joy, my deepest cry. He's with me through my every season. My God is here, Emmanuel.
