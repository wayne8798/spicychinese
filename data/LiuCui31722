 Yes, he killed it. The dog howled painfully so I ran 2 the balcony&amp; saw... Sometimes a tragedy just happens &amp; we just don't know WHY

 Aristotle is right. We're made of strings but the string theory can't explain human behaviors.

 Ur door's not locked&amp; I visited ur house. Used 2 read many ppl's tweets when I wanted 2 know more about Twitterland&amp;western cultures
 But you will, right? (Please keep it for future use.) 😄
 I thought about it before. It's possible that my cousin chose to kill herself partly because she didn't want to burden her daughter.
 Thank you. I'll read it &amp; consider recommending it to her daughter as her husband has depression,too. It's a long&amp; complicated story
 站長，Jennifer演講的簡體字版本已做好。這講稿可以通過網路內容檢查嗎?請不用註明翻譯者，因為我怕萬一被列入黑名單，以後還想去中國大陸旅行。沒惡意，是非理性恐懼沒錯，尤其不太了解的時候。 :-)

 
 Congratulations! :) 
 ,too, if experiencing what they'd suffered. That must be a completely different world from the ones we live in.
 Ppl who commit suicide only hurt those who love them! Still they're nobler than killers. Besides, I suspect we might kill ourselves
 Hilarious? Are u sure? I mean it's about youth&amp;memories. U seem to take it quite lightly! Maybe u're already enlightened. ;-D
 Glad for my cousin that u understand her. She shouldn't sadden her mom &amp; daughter but perhaps she REALLY couldn't bear it anymore...
 It's good to fall asleep easily.One of my cousins with depression took sleeping pills for yrs before committing suicide 6 yrs ago...
 Can you attach an album of yours if I pay more? Is $33333 enough (Seriously) ? Maybe not(Sigh)? Soft &amp; Gentle vs Wild &amp; Free!
 How lucky I am to have two favorite singers in the world. One died young, at the age of 42,&amp; the other just released 4 songs.
I know U're all GREAT,@Cher,,@LadyGaga,@KatyPerry, &amp;AndyPrieboy. But preference is SO subjective!
 Now I know why after I clicked the map. #politics
A great &amp; inspiring speech about fighting hunger. 
 Thanks for sharing the site. Surprised to learn that we still have undernourished population (5-14%)!

 最慢11月10號我會把有中文字幕的影片做好，到時候該怎麼把有簡體字幕的影片給你呢?網路上有一些方式可以下載YouTube影片(例如Kej's)，或者我也可以直接把影片email給你；用什麼方式你方便呢?
 Another singer I love. She's not cool nor powerful. She's a person of kindness and character. RIP TT: 
 Prefer this singer to Cher. I mean what I said. If she hold a concert, I'll be there. Love her voice!

 嗨! 站長，我打算把Jennifer的演講配上繁體中文字幕放到Youtube上，如果您想要簡體字版本的話，我可以順便做一個簡體字版本，只是我的翻譯文可能會跟你的不太一樣。嗯...為什麼要這麼做呢?因為，關係到健康很重要，好的訊息需要散播出去。

It rains cats &amp; dogs this morning and I can't go swimming!(Oh, sh!t.)
Swimming is the most enjoyable activity for me on the weekend. Going to have a good sleep and I'll hit the pool right after waking up.
Just love the song,月琴(Yueh Chin).  Lose my words when music touches me.
 Why leave them behind? Don't they deserve protection? Of course not! On the contrary, they need it more than anyone else!!!
Wow!   Thanks for the shining stars that light up our way!  @Dakota_Juliiie  @raffaellaoriata
 It turns out that Jennifer doesn't have to post them herself. There are many posted by other followers already! AN AVALANCHE!

 Thank you, Jennifer, for the silent wisdom from the Dalai Lama and always enjoy your low-profile humor. Keep them coming. :-D
  Physics tells me what the heck the world is. And I love it.
 Can I been touched by deep philosophy or meanings in the movie, 'Gravity'? Hollywood big budget films didn't impress me so I ask.

 Did he relate Heart Sutra to quantum physics? (Excited) Heart Sutra is simply as beautiful as the universe.(Love them) #觀世音菩薩

 It's my fav sutra&amp;the only one I know. My fav version played for my mom during her last week of life. 
   Well, it means a lot of potential to be satisfied! Incurably optimistic.. 
   We will die anyway. But no guarantees that we'll die in better ways than a plane crash! No use to worry ;)
 You enlighten me with "share the love, light into dark." It's a great motto for a teacher. I'll bear it in mind. Thank you again!
    I see! I thought it was because they couldn't make their beds.
    As a copilot &amp; a pilot,  &amp; I can guarantee ur safety on a plane as we won't make it take off.
