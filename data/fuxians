Never be afraid of doing something different. Dare to be something more.
To them quiet looks like weakness but you don't have to fight it. Cause you're strong enough to win without the war.
Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be invisible.
Trust the one who's been where you are wishing all it was was sticks and stones.
