“: 如果我不联系你，你不联系我， 是不是总有一天，我们就成了陌生人？”
也许你已把我当作陌生人了
RT : Someone will always be prettier. Someone will always be smarter. Someone will always be younger. But they will never be yo…
RT : We met for a reason.
And we broke up.
For a reason too.
RT : what’s that thing called where ur crush likes u back 

oh yes 

imagination
I know it's time to leave. 
You will never feel anything no matter what I do. 
I'm only making myself more painful.
I wanted to text you , text you like how we always did. 
But I can never forget the hurt you brought for me.. 
It's too much for me.
Whenever I'm bored at work, we would msg and cheer each other.. But nothing now...
Feeling empty.
It has been a week since we broke off. 
Those nights alone are terrible. 
Those nightmares. 
The awakening of seeing no one beside hurts.
RT : There's always that one person that you've had feelings for since the moment you first met them.
RT : There's this one ex , where you can't forget . No matter how ... 😔
RT : I may be single but I'm not sad , I'm desperate . 😂😅
 haha! You better be!
Pain-ed
  -.-
RT : I really don't know how to Bring myself to Love anyone anymore . ❤️ Maybe just too afraid what Happened in the past will ha…
 when I still take him for granted I always did.But trust me , when the person don't even give a dam Nothing can save it anymore
RT : Sometimes , I just want to lock myself up at home alone , just , Leave me ... Alone . 😔
 who???
 NB ! You call your darling ah pui! _|_
RT : Ask yourself.
What do you really want?
 wth!!!
I miss the memories ...
RT : Why must hint hint?
Can't you just be straight forward?
RT : All of us.
Have the one irritating friend.
That we love and hate so much.
RT : YP?
You were once YP too.
Think before you speak.
Thanks.
也许我们从来的不适合
我会勇敢面对你，证明我可以放下你给我的痛
给证明没有你我会过的更精彩的！
You'll never know what you wants after changes of things in life.
 ya I saw their texts !
忍住！
You're the one that I can see you in my future. 
But I'm never the one that will be in your future. 
Lets Just return back to our own world.
说了再见，你就不要在挽留我。
我们从来都不属于在同个世界里
I do still have feelings for you, but I will never admit that you're all I wanted.
RT : Couples will be like "OMG bby, I can't live without u!".

Eh pundeh, u tell this line to how many ppl already uh?

Cb …
RT : If you're want me to stay, please put in some efforts. If not, just get out of my life. It doesn't matter anyway, isn't …
 yes, it sucks
RT : Enough of your games.
Please.
RT : 不吃回头草.
You say a tranny cute ? 
You ask a tranny for love experience ? 
Know what ? I cannot accept.
I don't need any hope or promises. 
I just want to get afresh without you in my life anymore.
Your beautiful lies is not worth me to be stupid and silly for anymore.
Because our love is tiring , you choose to hurt me so deeply. 
Why didn't you just leave one year ago when I'm tired?
I was being told that we can be very close even after breaking up but only friends and no more.
RT : I am tired of wanting something I know I'll never have.
RT : Don't take advantage of me I'm already damaged enough.
RT : W/o even realizing it, you taught me a lot of things. Not only about life but how its okay to feel something extraordina…
RT : I don't know why I'm still holding on I just have this little hope that one day a miracle could happen.
RT : 不属于我的 永远都不会属于我的 😔
这辈子与你再不会有缘份了。
I don't wish to be fake anymore. I don't to smile and laugh anymore
我知道不可能但我只能绕着你
就算有了全世界，我也只想要你而已
Speechless. 
How you want me to believe !
The worst feeling ever 
 Strangers with memories ! ):
我傻傻的以为，我们还会有可能
原来是您的怜悯与同情
Stay calm don't run wild of my thinking~
RT : We never should have met.
RT : I am never good enough for you.
 it will be harder to do than saying :(
RT : Thanks for giving me the courage to move on.
RT : Our love has.
Died.
 me too :/
RT : Once i start tweeting.
I can never stop.
“: 爱你.
就是放手.”
RT : RT.
If you feel like slapping someone.
Right now.
RT : When one door closes.
Another opens.
 they will never know.
RT : The more you care.
The more you get hurt.
RT : Time to put and end to everything.

“: 这个世界上最不开心的，是那些懂得太多和想得太多的人。”
RT : To keep someone around you is not love; love is to let the one you love go freely. 不是把对方留在自己身边才叫爱，能放手让所爱的人离开，也是爱的一种。
RT : 他有多好，是他的；他对你有多好，才属于你的。
RT : 我从来不喜欢和别人争东西，你喜欢就拿去，前提是你能拿得走。
RT : 有时候不是不懂，只是不想懂；有时候不是不知道，只是不想说出来；有时候不是不明白，而是明白了也不知道该怎么做，于是就保持了沉默。
RT : 遇见你，是我一生最美丽的意外。我不知道该说什么，我只是突然在这一刻很想你。。
RT : 多希望我只是个孩子，给颗糖就笑，摔倒了就哭。不用伪装到面目全非，不用压抑自己的心情。
感觉一旦消失，承诺就只是一张白纸
RT : 因为爱过，所以不会成为敌人，因为伤过，所以不会做朋友。
RT : 人最软弱的地方， 舍不得一段不再精采的感情，我们永远以为最好的日子是会很长很长的，不必那么快离开。就在我们心软和缺乏勇气的时候，最好的日子毫不留情地逝去了。这个世界上，总有一个人在某处等你。不在这里，不是此时，便会在那里，是彼时，等你。
RT : 有些人说不出哪里好、但是就是谁都替代不了
时间会告诉我，那段难挨的日子我是如何走过来。时间也会告诉你，你是如何失去一个愿意用生命爱你的人。
RT : 酒，喝的半醉的好，喝的太多就醉了。爱，还是半真的好，爱的太深就心碎了。
RT : 你永远都不会知道，为你乱想的人有多么爱你。。。
RT : 有没有这么一个人，曾经占据了你全部的生活，现在却连声问候都会觉得尴尬。
RT : 有时候我们想爱的不是一个人而是一个故事。
I'm one of it ): 
分手是一件痛苦的事情，但那就只是一个瞬时的动作，大部分的人真正害怕的只是面对分手的失恋期，那是一段黑暗的，沉沦的，心痛的，悲伤的，无法自拔的用无数个24小时组成的时间段。”
RT : 有些事，发生了就只能接受。有些人，失去了就只有放手。有些路，选择了就没得回头。
RT : 日久不一定生情，但必定见人心。有时候也怕，时间会说出真话。
RT : 如果有人在喝醉的时候给我打来电话 哪怕他说着一大堆不着边际的话语 哪怕他吵醒了我的好梦 我还是会静静的听他说完 因为 我知道 我对他来说是个很重要的存在
“: 每个人一生之中心里总会藏着一个人，也许这个人永远都不会知道，尽管如此，这个人始终都无法被谁所替代。­ 而那个人就像一个永远无法愈合的伤疤，­ 无论在什么时候，只要被提起，或者轻轻的一碰，就会隐隐作痛。”
RT : 可笑的是，我们在朋友面前假装心理专家，但却连自己的问题都解决不了。
RT : 我这一生最美好的场景 就是遇见你
 you're welcome  :)
RT : 爱你.
就是放手.
 I also want to cut !
RT : 其实，我很累了。我习惯假装开心、假装难过、假装在意、假装无所谓，习惯了一个人面对所有。我可以在，很痛的时候说没关系。我可以在，难过的时候说无所谓。我可以在，寂寞时候哈哈大笑。我可以在，绝望的时候说世界依然美好。我只是希望在，我开始抱怨上天的吝啬…
 he will never be the one doing that for me anymore !😢😢
 ya lo!
RT : Do you enjoy hurting me so much?
RT : I don't want to be friends with you.
Do you not understand?
RT : We were never meant to be.
So many bullshit running through my mind :/
 go whatsapp I show you something :/
  no ! You cause my insomnia ! ):
 oh! I like ! (:
 huh?
RT : If you truly love someone, all you want is for them to be happy.
RT : I'm stuck between "I really want to talk to you," but "I really need to get over you."
 
RT : I wish some nights lasted forever.

RT : Loving someone is giving them a Reason to Smile . ❤️ #lovequotes
RT : I'm sick &amp; tired of quarrelling.
Heart ached.
I.. Miss him. All thanks to 
RT : When you both want each other , Shit happens . 😐
The wind is blowing so hard on me. 
But without you anymore.
平静多了
I hate , hate your comfort. 
Hate the love that is hypocrite. 
Hate all the presence that you left. 
I hate you.
痛！很痛！
I will bring myself to smile , to laugh and to enjoy. 
That the only way I can be stronger each passing day.
This is the only place where I can let my thoughts out.
Everytime I see you online whatsapp , I make myself thinks that you're texting her. I make myself feel the pain and the hurt.
看着伤口不知觉的想起你
能不能让我喝下忘情水或孟婆汤还让我忘记这些痛？
RT : If a #Leo gives you their trust, do not break it. They will never trust you again.
RT : I am a #Leo because I will be crying 1 min and ready to whip your ass the next but still love you thru it all.
RT : A #Leo will put the person they love before themselves, seeing someone smile because of them is gratitude enough.
RT : It takes a lot to piss a #Leo off. When it happens, revenge is inevitable and usually legendary.
RT : #Leo's give respect when respect is given, especially in relationshipsyou get what you put in.
RT : #Leo loves the simple things. Funny, considering how complex and deep their minds are.
心还是会隐隐作痛
我也会狠下心来把你忘了
我的世界容不下背叛。
不要对我再说爱。
已经没有理由再让我爱。
你的虚伪、你的狠心
Wonderful :)
You broke up with me because you want to have reason to get her a home cooked valentine. 
You started msging her when you said you're tired
I'm just hurting myself ):
遍体鳞伤，伤痕累累
也许你在也不需要我了。
但你不知道，如果我不再挣扎
那明白了告诉你，我的心已随着你的遗弃而去了。。。
RT : I miss how we use to talk day and nite but too bad thats the past liao its not going to happen again i guess
Why must you put me through all this pain ?
The urge of calling you on phone talking like no tml  , of rushing toward you hugging like we used to be.
He said he couldn't be there for me anymore ):
我能挽回那份曾经深爱着我的你吗？😢😣😩 
RT : Don't focus on the door that closed, you may miss the one that opened for you.
RT : Sometimes, you gave up on someone. Not because you don't care but because they don't.
RT : If someone doesn't see you in their future, maybe it's time for you to put them in your past.

RT : A real relationship 
RT : I hate those late nights where you feel like talking to someone you don't speak to anymore.
RT : I don't know where I stand with you, nor do I know what I mean to you. All I know is that every time I think of you, I wa…
RT : I'll never forget the first day we started talking.


RT : Don't chase people. Be you, do your own thing and work hard.. The right people who belong in your life will come to you, …
RT : l need a hug. No. l need your hug.
RT : Silence is a girl's loudest cry. You can always tell she's really hurt when she starts ignoring you
This seem impossible“: I want our relationship to be like Tom and Jerry. No matter how many times we fight, we won't be apart.”
RT : I still remember the feelings I felt when we first started talking.
RT : All I want is you.
RT : Behind every girl’s favorite song, is an untold story.
Am I fighting alone ? #“: A relationship is worth fighting for, but not if you're the only one fighting”
RT : I miss how close we were.
RT : Go for someone who is not only proud to have you, but will also take every risk just to be with you.
RT : I've always wanted to be dead for a day, only one day. Just to see who truly cares about me.
RT : If you got somebody who will ride through thick &amp; thin and hold it down for you, don't ever play them. You'll end up play…
RT : The best thing I can do is wait for you.

RT : I wish some nights lasted forever.
RT : Broken trust and anger will close a heart until honesty and love is once again found.
RT : Every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is if you still want to be together when things go wrong.
RT : You know someone means a lot to you when their mood can easily affect yours.
我怕我有的希望到头来是一无所有。
如果给我选择
我宁愿用我的一生来换你的快乐
如果哪天你开口说我们不要见了
那么也许这辈子就真的见不到了
我好累啊！
有那么一股冲动，放弃自己
放弃他就已经在放弃我自己了。
心好痛，眼泪不停流。
RT : NEVER GIVE UP ON SOMEONE YOU LOVE ! ❤️
Baby , I love you like how my life is.
I know we can never be the same.
But some parts of you, I still feel the love!
I miss our everything ! I know regretting is stupid. 
I know clinging on is nothing.
I know I shouldn't hope for anything
遍体鳞伤的我，找不到曾经了
只怕自己再也不会爱别人了
我爱不起更伤不起！
I can find myself in you but I don't know the reason why you had push me away.
Maybe I should have given up on my dream work.
我们不会在像从前那么天真
爱情也不会像从前那么纯真
过去，我们还能找回吗？
Memories are the most sweetest parts that form up who we are , but yet it can be the most dangerous that change who we are too.
RT : If you have #Leo trust, don't lose it and if you have #Leo heart, please don't abuse it.
RT : One day #Leo will start sending you mixed signals, and you'll get mad because they finally learned how to play your game.
RT : We all #Leo live in a time period of smart phones and stupid people.
RT : #Leo are not heartless, they have just learned how to use their heart less.
 happy ?!? I got face for my twitter Liao :3
