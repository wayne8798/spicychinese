 where have Pitbullfans,where he is.
 LadyGaga also wanna go to China,but Chinese government dont allow it,she know China is a good place to have concert
 right,another reason is Chinese is a lot,so Pitbullfans is also a lot,its a good choice to have concert
 pit always this style,that why we love him so much,we neednt him to change style for others,just the way he is
RT : I love  4 himself&amp;his great music!he pours his heart in his songs,no one can ask me for more reasons!!!!! http://t.c…
 maybe China is not good choice to sale album,but its a good choice to have a concert,most people like to watch concert
 pit have ROM,international love,DSTP,FTM,BIT and so on,it just not hit like GME,but these songs all hit
 but not hit like umbrella
    @Miley_EmCyrus Pit can have 2 concerts in China,LadyGaga cant,KatyPerry cant,he is MrWorldwide
    @Miley_EmCyrus I mean Rihanna cant have another single like #umbrella,but she is not a flop
@Miley_EmCyrus     let him go,Pit need us to scream for him😘😘,not call pit is a flop😡😡
    @Miley_EmCyrus Rihanna cant make #Umbrella2.0, could you say that she is a flop??
 @Miley_EmCyrus   He's really improving,so dont use billboard to measure him
   @Miley_EmCyrus flop means album and single all flop,but 1st week of GW is 67000,the PP just 50000+
":   @Miley_EmCyrus then your a hater not a fan"cant agree more,he is a hater,Billboard is only a part
 @Pitbull cuteeeeee!!!!!
