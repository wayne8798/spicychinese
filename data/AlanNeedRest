Best things in life, chilling by the coast with brothers.
Standard nights out with best bros!  
Do you know why I don't like talking to you? Because you're fucking irritating. So stop talking to me. Period.

Always thought what I was doing was enough to make you happy, but guess I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Give ourselves some time to think through.
Looking through the first photo and the journey since day 1.
一公升的眼泪。

很想把一切的烦恼给哭出来。。
就算我们之间有什么难题,黑夜我还想着你,心碎人孤寂,虽然我愿意,心还想着你.
Keep deceiving myself cause I'm too afraid to handle the fact.
My love for you will never fade no matter how tough things get! ❤️ @ Doreen's Lil Heart ❤️
