Lao ma zi 最好别再来惹我
RT : 我相信你说的每一句
就算是明知是甜言蜜语
可是我总觉得哪里有问题
也许这些话语不只说给我听
我相信是因为你的犹豫
所以把感情陷入难题
没关系我有做坏人的勇气
就算毁灭自己也要捍卫爱情
我全都相信相信你说的每一句
RT : 每一句我答应我可以我不会负你
每一句只差一句我爱你
就算是一切都变成回忆
可是我逃不开也回不去
也许这些话语是讽刺的回音
所以把我永远困在这里
没关系我会继续撑下去
给我勇气呼吸我只需要一句
我想你说不出我爱你

RT : 一直以为幸福在远方，
在可以追逐的未来。
我双眼保持着眺望，
我双耳仔细地聆听，
唯恐疏忽错过。
后来才发现，
那些握过手，
唱过歌，
流过泪，
爱过的人。
所谓曾经，
就是幸福……

有时候明明知道那是面走不过的墙却还是会很拼命地想越过那道墙。
认为即使撞墙了，至少没有遗憾。
明明喜欢却硬说讨厌因为知道自己无法超越自己的极限、因为知道自己无法在继续下去所以选择以讨厌的方式回避了自己最挚爱的人事物。
