Is it just me or there's some resemblance between Fred Astaire and Clark Gregg? #DaddyLongLegs
 Ha, no, it's an episode in S7. One of the monsters' name is Amy Pond. An alias I assume. But it's a reference of DW I guess?
Sam Winchester and Amy Pond are the new Romeo and Juliet? I don't know whether to clap my hands or bang my head against the wall... #SPN
Ew, ew, ewww!!! The Leviathans are the most disgusting monsters so far... Just. Gross. Bleh. #Supernatural
One thing I like about #SPN is how they  show the power and weakness of Free Will. How it can be twisted, manipulated or go out of hand...
Sorry. I know this should be all serious and shit, but Godstiel is just freaking hilarious to me... #TheManWhoKnewTooMuch #Supernatural
Aw. A T-rex would be so much more fun. NAH. It had to be demons. #TheManWhoKnewTooMuch #Supernatural
How is everyone on this show so terrible at lying?! #Supernatural
Sam going all Jason Bourne... I LIKE THIS EPISODE ALREADY. #TheManWhoKnewTooMuch #Supernatural
Cas is llike, the walking proof of "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." #TheManWhoWouldBeKing
It's painful to see a lying angel. #TheManWhoWouldBeKing #Supernatural #Castiel
Oh Cas. "Baby in a trench coat" sounds so right it's wrong. It shouldn't surprise you when people think you're a couple... #SPN #Destiel
I'm probably laughing more than I should at the "Jefferson Starships" thing... #Supernatural #DeanWinchester #MommyDearest

Now that I know the context of the infamous Cas "I need you to let me touch it" speech... It kinda ruined all the fun. #Frontierland #SPN
#Frontierland is cute.I'm having the feeling that #SPN writers just grab whatever is in their fandoms and put it on the show. #WesternFetish

 You're right. What was I thinking? Dean Winchester is ALWAYS so damn sexy. I'm just especially turned on when he's all smart-ass ;)
One thing that troubles me and I absolutely love it, is how they picture the celestial system and visualize heaven. It's very off. And cool.
