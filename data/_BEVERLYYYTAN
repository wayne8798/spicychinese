RT : 梦在远方 化成一缕香
随风飘散你的模样
菊花残 满地伤
你的笑容已泛黄
花落人断肠 我心事静静淌
北风乱 夜未央
你的影子剪不断
徒留我孤单 在湖面成双
花已伤完 飘落了灿烂

明明就他比较温柔, 也许他能给你更多。不用抉择我会自动变朋友
明明就不习惯牵手, 为何却主动把手勾
我不相信你口中会讲出后悔

It takes a turn and then it hurts more than you could dream of.

Thanks to Nich.

God didn't add another day in your life because you needed it, He added it because someone out there needs you.
Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.
When God puts love and compassion in your heart toward someone, He's offering you an opportunity to make a difference in that person's life.
