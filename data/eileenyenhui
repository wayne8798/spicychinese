爱情里最残忍的话不是我不喜欢你，而是你太好。原来太好也有错。

人往往喜欢做事与愿违的东西，明明知道不可以却还是一意孤行，最后一身是伤，才来后悔，说早知道。
永远都不会有早知道，早知道的话，我就是做飞机而不是坐汽车了! 😠
 Take care!! 😦

So tired 😴😴😴 Cn we just go bak home? ._.
RT : 每天告诉自己要努力，即使看不到希望，也依然相信自己。压力不是有人比你努力，而是比你牛叉几倍的人依然在努力。每个优秀的人，都有一段沉默的时光。那段时光，是付出了很多努力，忍受孤独和寂寞，不抱怨不诉苦，日后说起时，连自己都能被感动的日子。唯累过，方得闲…
你知道我想听的不是这些。
 u sit between me and ! Lets cry tgt =D

I was insulted because of my poor hearing 😢
总是再顾虑别人的感受，却忽略了自己的感受。
Don't be the prince, be the knight.

很多我，可是你了解哪个才是真的我吗...？
最亲近你的人也未必是最了解你的人。

别指望我谅解。
哀莫大于心死。

日久见人心。

我知道你开始厌倦。
一转身看到的人是你。
有些人的翅膀，总是特别耀眼。
这条路很难，但你还是选择走下去。
感谢你愿意去了解真正的我。
我们都在沦陷。不能再这样下去。
我为你感到失望。
