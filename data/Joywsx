 Yes. Sacrifice wisely. Meaning you have to know your body limits too. Jia you ! :)
 Then you have to sacrifice your dream. It's one way or another.
When you have a dream, you have to fight for it. This includes, sleepless nights, lost of appetite, tears. You just have to sacrifice.

My heart has died. What is left is my mind. The strongest survivor of me.
It is a marathon, not a sprinting race any more.

Worst feeling is that you feel fucking unhappy with such stupid plan but you can do nothing about it but only to continue. 🌵

 i'm feeling very down too, to the extend we just have to suck thumb and do. I really feel you. And this feeling really sucks much.
明明知道前面是一道墙还偏偏的往前走。何必？走向前只会伤害到自己，也有可能把那道墙摧毁。退后一步，把去这道墙的路程都忘了。忘了后就安然无恙了😊
I dreamt that I got magic powers..such that I can save the world like Bubbles.

If he was right, what should I do...😔
 Yes.. Need to remind ourselves everyday to give in our best in every aspect of our lives.
They say the graveyard is the richest place. A place with so much regrets, ideas, feelings, words that left unspoken.
Should I go to Japan?
As long as I am not dead yet, I will get up. I remember my visual board. I must keep moving and may god gives me Strength. I believe.
I worked so hard to be here. I must continue.
It's very hard to move forward when there is little hope. Reminding myself every time that even with that little hope, there is still hope.
Dinnerrrr 
逃避不是一个办法。办法只有一个。那就是面对。
I must and have to do something about it.

Feeling so calm and and happy after talking to you. I really miss it very very much.
RT : Sometimes I just want to run away from everything.
Is it because of that goal I'm aiming? I feel that I'm over pushing myself already. It should not be like that.

I am super thankful for the help i received from my friends. I wouldn't make it through the hell yesterday without them. So much thanks..
Perhaps, everything has changed.
If they fair well in life i will be happy for them but why can't they be happy for me when i'm doing well..?
I've reached the stage whereby I have to conserve my talking energy to do what is remaining.
