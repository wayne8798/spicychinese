Yet the stupid channel 8 drama plot, rather pay a compensation of 8million than accepting the 10billion and shifting co to Cambodia. STUPID
For our entrepreneurshio project, before we even start a biz, we are already estimating how much we want to sell the biz.
Contradicting drama. They portray Junwei as a inspiring entrepreneur. Yet, he does not understand the basic entre principles in the end.
One of the main reason of setting up a biz is to sell off in the end &amp; earn a lump sum what. Wtf
What's wrong with accepting the 10billion and shifting the co the cambodia? -.-
