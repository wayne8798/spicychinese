RT : 喜欢你的人，要你的现在。爱你的人，要你的未来。真正的爱情，不是一见钟情，而是日久生情；真正的缘份，不是上天的安排，而是你的主动；真正的关心，不是你认为好的就要求她改变，而是她的改变你是第一个发现的；真正的矛盾，不是她不理解你，而是你不会宽容她。
RT : 爱着一个不爱你的人就像抱着一颗仙人掌, 你抱得越紧就越受伤。
RT : 有一种爱情，叫白头偕老；有一种幸福，叫有你相伴。
RT : 刚刚在一起的时候, 所有人都觉得你们不可能在一起很久, 还有人等着看你们什么时候分手。后来你们经历了很多很多, 多到所有人都觉得没有事情可以分开你们了, 但你们却真的分开了。
RT : 你永远也不会知道，她因为爱你，在你看不到的地方做了什么事。
