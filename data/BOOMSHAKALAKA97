RT : i really just wanna end my life
I need people to console and encourage me :')


Not even i myself believe im going to a place i detest the most...
  thanks for the advises&amp;encouragements that both of you gave :') i appreciate it alot. At least i know there are ppl caring
  as long as you have $$, you can get in. Its private-funded.Im considering Temasek poly or Pioneer JC. :')
  anyone can get into laselle seriously. They dont look at the portfolio from what i heard. Its such a sad reality :')
 its okay! :) replied
RT :  
Never give up no matter what. That's what differentiate the strong from the weak. And I know you're stron…
  im really losing hope :( I learnt a precious lesson today about life and reality. This is cruel but i cannot be blinded :')
  in your favour? Thats what im worried about... And there are definitely better designers out there besides me. Oh god...
  what if im not the 2%? I'll have no way to go on. We always expect our future to be better ones but what if the odds are not
A faint hope.
Was confident that im able to become a successful designer if i tried my best. But not any more. I've to face the reality and consequences
 they are the only poly which offers fashion design course :) i heard mr rahim said they are famous for their fashion design :')
  yeah but its not easy as it seems.. its like 2% out of the 100%... thats reality..
 yeah im considering pioneer jc , temasek poly or laselle now.. :')
 haha omg such a coincidence that we saw each other at jem ;) where are you both  heading huh ~~~~
 but definitely taking a shorter route is better.. dreams just shattered really its impossible to earn a living if im learning art..
 still not sure yet. Pioneer JC, laselle , temasek poly? in dilemma ..you?
 decided the course??

 like art no future .. just a broken dream :')
...&lt;3 
 no.Going to poly is not a dead end. Going to a art school is
 going to laselle is just too unrealistic.. im too stupid to think that life is so simple at the first place
what is life
