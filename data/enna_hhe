No matter how much i done,you dont appreciated .还吹毛求疵. I'm tired with this kind of life already .
If i hate everything ,what did i love ?
I'm not hate you,or dislike you. You just a stranger for me.哀莫大于心死。
Time past,life change,things change,people change,but memories don't.
Eventhough i have many things wishes to done in my life,but my hope still same :平凡中带点不平凡的过生活,但决不是惊吓!
If i wanna hate you,don't expect i will forgive you.You lose the chance of reunion and breaks our relationship .
不再意别人的眼光,做个阔达的人,也需要勇气啊!
虚伪的定义是什么 ? 我只不过是希望大家和睦共处,以和为贵,避免不和加深,伤感情罢了。难道退一步忍让有错吗?
