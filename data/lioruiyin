RT : Hard for En to win BA tis year. Tonglin is gd but nt good enough as compared to chuning
RT : No... 
RT : She is the best actress. Even if she doesn't win, she is still the best best best best actress in my heart💕
RT : Did the judges watch #sudden at all? Ep 15. Go n rewind pls
RT : Tonglin instead of chuning. It's still Rui En. But the chances of winning BA is lower nw.
RT : truth 
RT : #StarAwards20  Best Actress Nominees:  , 瑞恩, 陈莉萍 from 志在四方,  from Sudden,  from 唐山
RuiEn has not much chances to win BA.They proposely one.
RT : Gahh can't appeal for tat choice..
RT : Obviously she has a better chance with Sudden, comedic roles rarely win...
RT : 他們故意的。she nominate for tdm instead of sudden? Seriously. Okay.... 做牌....
RT : seriously. are the judges blind? or have they not watch sudden wtf.
They don't even care about Sudden.Chuning and Qiliang is not even in.Only Weiqian is in.
Surprising Elvin didn't even get nominated.
RT : Why not chuning for #ba2014
They proposely put tonglin bcos they don't want RuiEn to win again.Usually they will give the role that cried a lot for BA.
RT : WHAT THE HELL. WHY IS SHE NOT NOMINATED FOR SUDDEN ?! ASDFGHJKL
How could you nominate tonglin but not chuning just bcos of The Dream Makers?Sooooo unfair Chuning cried her lung out!!
At lease Channel 8 still have some 良知 to nominate Tonglin.But Chu Ning is the best can???
RT : omg, she cried like in 5 seconds.
RT : Whatever, at least the one ch 8 mentioned was not her. Chu Ning is still my BA. Yah, but CLP should get it.
RT : Her performance in #sudden is like way better. But its fine :) At least a nomination.
RT : even if she doesn't win it, but she should at least be nominated for her role in Sudden ?!
RT : what the hell, Chu Ning's not nominated for BA?!
RT : WHY WHY WHY WHY IS RUI EN NOT NOMINATED AS CHENG CHU NING FOR HER ROLE IN SUDDEN ?!
RT : She should be nominated for her role as ChuNing in Sudden. She should have higher chance of winning then. But better than not…
RT : But come on lah, how can chu ning not be in it, I rather chu ning get in rather than tong lin
Disappointed to channel 8.
Why channel 8 like this???I want Chu Ning!!Channel 8 do you know RuiEn put in how much effort in Sudden?!She cried her lung out do you know?
I think channel 8 proposely put RuiEn nominated in Fang Tonglin So that if RuiEn didn't win,they still have excuse to say others are better.

I know you enjoy scolding.Go other place to scold.
Whatever we do you also got something to say.Even if we done our best,you still have something to scold.鸡蛋里挑骨头。
.You find it very interesting to keep on repeating the same thing everyday? Well,I don't find it fun at all.
.Really wonder that what makes you scolded so long also don't even felt annoying.
长大后才知道，以前小时侯在意，想要的东西，现在都变得不重要了。
