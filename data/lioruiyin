 I know that 715 fans love 715 with JA too.I love ruimeo more than ruiwu too.That is why it is so confusing.
Why  this year like this one this year RuiEn may not get Jubin's fans so much,and rangels vote splitting,qiwuyu fans prefers715 wif ouxuan.
 don't leh I know ruimeo is good,I love them too but if like this the vote may split,and even ruimeo get,RuiEn wont be so happy

Whatever.As long as RuiEn is happy.Ruiwu gambateh!
But I prefers ruimeo more.But anyway nevermind.Bcos RuiEn prefers this.Let's do this to make RuiEn happy.This is our aim.Make RuiEn happy.
Yerr why rbkd tell us to vote RuiEn&amp;qiwuyu.
1.RuiEn prefers this.
2.But the vote may split bcos qiwuyu has another pairing with ou xuan
