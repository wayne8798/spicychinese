亲爱的，学会爱惜自己多一点吧，我已学会放开了，几时才轮到你呢？
人生短短几十年，何必让自己过的那么不开心呢？
嘴巴是人家的，人家爱说什么就让他们说吧，如果我们那么容易就被人家说的东西影响到那我们不是很失败了吗？
  first time see u left shoes at practice place.
Gah...I miss you :3

Be with someone who brings out the best in you, not the stress in you.
Loyalty is rare. If you find it, keep it
I hate the distance you create after we get close.
Woo so many to do....
Yum cha time ;) uptown brother john burger

Success is a journey, not a destination. The process is often more important than the outcome. =)

Just because your life isn't like what you want it to be, doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.
 scary hor T.T
Happiness is what happens to us when we try to make someone else happy.
Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret. =')
Got home from outside and took a pic of my car...This scene is creepy 😲😲😲 
The best things happen unexpectedly.

TUMBLING IS THE BEST RELIEVER
Cheerleading is not just something you can stop doing - it gets into your blood and stays with you for the rest of your life.

Nobody deserves to be treated like an option.

If you have never made a mistake then it means you have never tried something new.
Forgive yourself. Move on from your past. Embrace the future. Mistakes don't hold you back, your mindset does. =)
I feel generations nowadays express better with thumb than mouth , maybe cause the thumb and heart got a direct path to deliver messages.
What a long talk, but it's a healthy talk. Just like vitamins,  I need them.
Sometimes bad things happen, and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry? –Simba (The Lion King)
Hardest thing in life, letting go of what you thought was real. #LetItGo
When I look in the mirror, the only person I see is my competitor, I will be a better chiaki!

Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people. If they care, they'll notice. If they don't, you know where you stand.
Are you okay?” Always the same question. “I’m fine.” Always the same lie.
还是学不会
妈,没有你怎么办?
Care too little, you'll lose them. Care too much, you'll get hurt.
I didn't emo....Just felt sorry...
RT : When a #Libra fucks up, they wont hide it.
The feeling is so bad that it's worst than being hurt by you....sorry sisters :'( it's not worth it.....
Today, I let 4 of my most important woman in my life down....I feel like shit right now....sorry
Life's too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So, love the people who treat you right and forget about the ones who don't. =)
Can't sleep...thanks to the coffee I drank this morning. ..:/
RT : Many astrologers believe #Libra is the most desirable sign to be because Libra represents the high point of the Zodiac.
The past is behind, Learn from it. The future is ahead, Prepare for it. The present is here, Live it.
The best feeling is when you realize you mean something to someone. =)
Don't think too much, you'll just create a problem that wasn't even there in the first place. =)
I’m like a butterfly, pretty to see but hard to catch. 
You can make everything when you believe in yourself. =)
 hahaha....=p
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy.  I learned :')
Keep moving forward.
A best friend isn't someone who's just always there for you. It's someone who understands you a bit more than you understand yourself.
Nothing is worth it if you are not happy. So damn true!
Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid of not trying. =)
Life is too short, so laugh when you can, apologize when you should and let go of what you can't change.
The worst part of life is waiting. The best part of life is having someone worth waiting for. =')
It's crazy how I automatically smile when I talk to you.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right. =)
Sometimes I feel like we're friends, sometimes I feel like we're more than friends, but sometimes I feel like I'm just a stranger to you
Keep calm and stay strong. =)
I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.
Don't give up just because things are hard.
Don't let something tear you down. Allow it to help you move on to something better.
No doesn't mean never. It just means not yet
 true like fuck
Robocop anyone?
