Sibeh dulan. Am sick and still have to endure this shit attitude 😒
 I just cannot understand him. Don't wanna interact with family members. Just goof all day in the cyber world. Sibeh dulan lo
 and that's the reason why I treated him badly because of his response and attitude
 I did admit that I didn't care much last time. But people grow up. And then he =.=
Trying to make this family better and there he goes. He and his weird attitude
Tried to care for my brother, and he replied: 你以前都没有这样关心的，你现在关心到很恶心。 fine.
