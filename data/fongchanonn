DAP's silence on the validity of its leadership assignment at its illegal CEC is deafening.
Issues DAP have 2 answer:
1 wrong results CEC meet illegal.
2 office bearers assignment voided
3 CEC illegal only EGM can overturn results.
LKS said DAP's last 3days most difficult. It's because they know result meltdown 1day after but covered up n then went on long holiday.
Now LGE says election errors cannot be rectified for 3 wks because 'leaders' on holidays. Come on never hear of video conference??
Admitting your party election meltdown is fine; but for 3 wks u know u have no standing u still call yourself chairman, SGen etc?? Honesty?
LGE must come clean. Was it b4/during/after meeting that assigned leaders that he knew of election meltdown? Whatever d meeting was voided.
U all r working hard! Tq RT :  nice to see u last thursday at seri malaysia..”
In election law once results certified by election officer d result can only b overturned by court, but by an arbitrary meet of persons.
DAP knew of election errors nextday as claimed but d 20 'winners' still met n elect leadership amongst themselves! D process is null void!
Next time you receive a presentation on Microsoft excel chase the presenter away because from DAP logic excel makes huge errors!
Happy n successful 2013 every1. Got up n went for a long walk to reflect on 2012 n form new targets 2013. Wish every1 happiness n g health!
