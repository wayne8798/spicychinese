愛一個人最好的方式,就是經營好自己. 給對方一個優質的愛人.
不是拼命對一個人好, 那人就會拼命愛你.
俗世的感情難免有現實的一面.
你有價值, 你的付出才有人重視.
I love my tweeter profile picture XD

RT : 有一种爱，明明是深爱，却说不出来；有一种爱，明明想放弃，却无法释怀；有一种爱，明知是煎熬，却又躲不开；有一种爱，明知结果是伤痛，心却早已收不回来……  
Will you married to a guy you like but not love?
RT : 都不知道现在的你心里在想着谁,
可我却在这里继续默默的想着你。
突然觉得自己有点可笑,又有点可悲。

RT : 如果一个人记得你的生日 记得你喜欢什么讨厌什么 把你不经意说过的话都放在心上 为你无数次影响情绪却从来不让你看到他脆弱的样子 为你做他不喜欢的事 为你放下面子放下所谓的原则放下他的一切 为你改掉坏脾气 为你拒绝所有暧昧 为你变得面目全非 …

RT : 我会很好的控制自己。
RT : 有时候，同样的一件事情，我们可以安慰别人，却说服不了自己。
RT : Don't think, and don't worry. If the time comes, you will know what to do.
RT : Moving on doesn't mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what happened and continue living.
RT : The hardest decision you will ever have to make, is whether to stay and try harder, or take the memories and walk away.
RT : There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult when you do it reluctantly.

Find someone who is worth your heart, tears, laughter and that loves you as much as you love them.

RT : I pretend to ignore you, but I really just miss you.
I'm at Strawberry Cafe (Sitiawan, Perak)

Dear friends.
God, can you make an arrangement in helping me to meet some bad guy in the rest of my life?
I'm at Sungai Burung Selangor (Sungai Besar, Selangor) 
RT : 我不要比你更好的，我要的就只是你。无论你怎么折磨我，都没关系。也不要惩罚自己不跟我在一起，不如惩罚我让我永远呆在你身旁不是更好吗？
這些話適應於那些放不下的孩子: 其實有時候想想, 是真的愛得深, 還是不甘心.
Emo doesn't helps anything. So stop doing it.
I don't need anyone. Stay alone from me.

It's time to have a new hair style :)
Can't fall asleep for few days. Sounds bad? No. That's great :))
Busy day :)
RT : 一个人至少拥有一个梦想，有一个理由去坚强。心若没有栖息的地方，到哪里都是在流浪。生命中有三件事会一去不返，时间，机会和说出的话。看懂一件事，长大了。看清一件事，开窍了。看破一件事理性了。看透一件事，成熟了。看穿一件事到头了。看淡一件事放下了。
RT : All I want is someone who will stay, no matter how hard it is to be with me.
RT : 虽然没见面，但听见声音已足够。大家还是老样子。
#勇敢地去做選擇 為你的未來打拼

And if you're not honest they say you're fake. 😒

RT : 以往總是喜歡用文字
來詮釋自己的心情

不過直到我
真正失去了一樣東西
才發現語言多麼的脆弱和無力

文字與感覺 永遠有隔閡。
RT : 宁愿深深的伤一次也不愿错过。
RT : 当你想念一个人的时候，尽情去想念吧，也许有一天，你再也不会如此想念他了。到了那一天，你会想念曾经那么想念一个人的滋味。当你爱一个人的时候，尽情去爱吧，也让他知道你是如此爱他。也许有一天，当你长大了，受过太多的伤，失望太多，思虑也多了，你再也不会那么…
Just like a dream.
To be callous, at first you have to get nothing.
