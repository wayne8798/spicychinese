My thoughts on this!  
Reading this and having glass of wine at home enjoying a quiet Friday night! Thank God - weekend is here! #books 
My EQ does drop with stupidity! Like after the 5th time of modifying something shows that someone doesn't know what she wants! Waste of time
Yes. Some people are just a pure waste of space.
Don't waste your life thinking negatively, create a life that you want positively! #hakmethoughts
