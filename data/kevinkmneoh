D-Wade now a worthy Three time #NBAChamp.  I want a piece of his jersey.
In 2010  realized Rebounds make the difference n he focus grabbing rebounds n LAL won. Seems like Wade is doing just tat. #Game7

KG was so close to leaving C's n D-12 so close to leave LAL, the impact was minimal compared to KG's situation. #Matured #Leader #BigTicket
So much chatters about Ginobili struggle, n he gets his first start for Game5. #Redemption #NBAFinals #GameFive
