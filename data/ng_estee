Yay! Finished SS!!! Time for English! After English, Geog time! I think I'm gonna die though.. the Valency table and Separation Techniques..

No Math Common Test hahahahaha.... but chinese, english, sciences, GEOG, SS, I'm gonna die
 😊😊

Geog is... actually quite fun... the only problem is that I keep falling asleep...
Didn't know I could actually sprain my ankle while walking...

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 ohh hahah okay 😊
 😂😂😂😂 laugh all the way back to school... He just kept flipping the pages and "this one you all can do yourselves" 😂
 okayyyy hahah thankssss
 IKR 😂😂😂😂 "Task 8 you can do yourself" 😂😂😂😂
  😂😂😂 correct what
 hahaha ca... but you got dental 😂😂😂
  yay okay... then if we know the ions, no need learn compounds hehe... Other than the stranger ones
 yay!!!!!!! See you tmrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!
 those are people who are good in chinese kaysss
 considered quite good liao horh.. alot of peeps failed
 you so smart... 9 lehhhhh... then chinese also so good... my chinese is like 💩
 says the ones who's so smart 😁just try and form your own answer... If not everybody copy Mr N's answer, He also no need mark le
I hope I don't fail chem... and geog... though we've yet to take the test but urgh... its so hard. My motivation: 'A Date With K-pop Stars'
 but I think you're supposed to have your own answer
 I think so
I should really get to work! Chop chop! As soon as I finish eating hehe
I really don't feel like doing the SS worksheet... although Mr N already gave us the answer 😂😂
  that one if you know the ions then should be able to combine them together right
  I don't think compounds are necessary 😂😂😂
Do we really have to learn the valency table...........
 cos you're at popular again 😂😂😂
Whenever I study really hard for chinese, my results are like 💩 WHYYYYYYYY

IT'S COMING... COMMON TESTS ARE COMING REAL SOONNNNNNN 😞
I just realised I haven't eat my kinder joy
 jiayou jiayou! Choir's really fun! 😁
 hahas thank you 😊
 but as long as you got watch it's okay! Jiayou for tuition! And whatever upcoming tests you have! 💪
But more things to study for SA1
But still SA1 would be testing everything learnt... which doesn't really make any difference... Other than lesser things to study for CTs
How I wished common tests would start now... at least there wouldn't be so many things to study
I really hope that you won't come in, but I guess your decision is fixed... 😪
 it's okay! You can still catch up on xinmsn... but hor... it would be as fun as watching it when it premieres...
It's time to promote ^^
