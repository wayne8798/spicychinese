Word 
“The only reason why cancers mood swings from hot to cold is because they lose security – overthinks due to their sensitivity.”
“孩子一样容易付出、容易受伤、容易复原，相信爱，实践爱。”
“如果你爱上巨蟹座，就保持这样的心态：
1你不能计较他的自私
2性格开朗，爱玩爱笑
3绝不能挑战他的自尊心
4最好不要和巨蟹座吵架
5巨蟹座在生气的时候说的话，你不能计较当真
6你的外在不能输给大众，即使你不够美到艳压群芳，你起码要是有个性有特色。
【这样的巨蟹座你能不爱吗】”
“巨蟹座不会伪装，
连听到那个人的名字，
连一个释怀的微笑都做不到。”
请。

(please)

“遇见巨蟹座的孩子，请珍惜。”
“对朋友很珍惜，真心对待。
面对爱情，怕受伤，爱逃避。”
