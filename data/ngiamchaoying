So are we supposed to assemble for you too? 什么都讲好了，你画，我们做报告，可是突然间你说要看那报告，你随后就改了它，你应该画而不是做这些，现在呢？你到头来还不是要讨功劳， 想把画画推给我们做，因为你不想做。

Overslept. Freaking late for my Kumon work. GG. 😔 That is why I don't give Saturday schedules. Today is a no choice.
过去的,你们弥补不了。现时, 你们也根本没想努力去弥补。
This year you all bothered to ask me but what's the point. Last year you all didn't &amp; it mattered to me.
Last year, without asking me, you all invited them to the house.
