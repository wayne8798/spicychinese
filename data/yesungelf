i tried singing exo chinese title songs but wolf rap was too hard, growl was even faster, mid was much slower but chen's part is so high :O
there is just something about WOLF that attracts me so much(though the song is really a bit weird haha), i like how intense dance is maybe!
this WOLF perf made me super obsessed with them,i remember it was during my june holidays last year haha

how HAPPY must chen be to have heard two fans saying that their fav exo member is him within the same day on 2 radio shows :D
exo mentioning kangin,ryeowook and kyuhyun as the sunbaes giving them lots of support, awww :') 
im so thankful for this korean fangirl for saying that her fav member is 'jongdae oppa' :') look how happy chen was:)

 haha but we will CRY for them T.T
 haha why leh? :P dun sound like me ah haha cause this account is mainly for my kpop uses de la :P
omg fx was standing in their ready position for RPPP then a weird long intro music started to play and they were like WHAT O.O
but they ended off nicely with saying chen is practising hard now and dancing chen machine only needs 2 hours :)
haha when asking how long does exo practice dancing, luhan says if it takes the better dancers 1 hour,chen takes 4 hours LOL XD
personal wishes aside, i just hope in 2014 SJ will have a comeback with yesung+teuk! and pls have many more support for kim jongdae :')
when exo or exo-m performs in china, all i always see are kris,luhan,tao,lay or other members, very little support for chenchen :(
 yeah lor so sad right...haix but when they happy we also happy haha XD but we are not those extreme and crazy fans la :P
it is so rare to see exo posting on weibo omg and lay just posted! kind healing unicorn loves his grandparents so much :')
but jongdae looks kind of sad today i dunno why :( it is not his usual cheerful self, maybe he is just tired, rest well! :)
i like when exo-m perform as 6 also because he does all the high notes himself, so proud haha :)
haha exo talking about their dancing again and chenchen XD 
 if he ever said AWWW it is definitely not JOHN NG! he ah 24/7 only one expression which is -.-
 IKR T.T it is the saddest 'love story' ever. the love story of a fangirl/fanboy haix...:'(
 haha aww, thanks for your message for the moon gang too~! john will surely be like -.- again LOL XD
so nice to see how SJ dotes on their hoobaes so much and how exo-m are so comfortable with SJ :) they are nice and funny sunbaes XD
i like when exo-m perform wolf or growl with just the 6 six them cause its really special to see how only 6 dances it(and chen is my bias):P
