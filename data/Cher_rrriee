RT : I want you. I need you.
RT : ": "
RT : 🌵🌵
RT : Even if the relationship is hell, a #Pisces will stick thru it &amp; try to make it work.
RT : If a #Pisces thinks the world is cold and harsh, they will escape into their own fantasy world for refuge.
RT : ": The worst feeling is when something is killing you inside, and you have to act like you don't care."
RT : ": I miss you, and it's killing me."
RT : Talk about life like we had a clue

RT : #Pisces is the sign that is the most considerate of others' feelings.
RT : I pretend to ignore you, but I really just miss you.

RT : Sometimes, I'm just a simple person who hides a thousand feelings behind the happiest smile.
RT : I don't hate you, its just.. Actually no, fuck you.
RT : Promise you'll never forget me.
RT : There is always one person in a relationship who loves more, cares more, cries more, gets hurt most &amp; even forgives more.

“: I mean nothing to you. I get it”
RT : Somebody like you 
RT : “I have been To every depth of my heart, To every height of my mind, To every extent of my world. I see only one name It’s …
RT : You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.
RT : We used to talk everyday. Now... We don't even say "Hey."
有肯能老天爷要我一个人孤零零生活..
“: 还是不够好”
RT : Tell me how to let go of something you care so much about.
“: I've never wanted anyone like I wanted you. And I lost you.”
RT : No matter what challenge you're facing, it's always alone.
RT : I miss your voice 
I miss your face
