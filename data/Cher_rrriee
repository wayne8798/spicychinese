RT : #Pisces are prone to self-hurt when love leaves their life.
RT : ": suicide in the form of falling in love with someone who can only love you back with a fraction of thei…
RT : 'Heart on your heart and my eyes on yours.'
RT : I distance myself from people for a reason 😒👌
RT : no mood.
RT : I'm not perfect, I make mistakes, I hurt people, but when I say sorry, I actually mean it.
RT : #Pisces relationships are like drugs. They either kill you or give you the best feeling of your life.
RT : You don't even know how bad I want you.
RT : Every pass memories flashing, increasing my fear level.
RT : Cross the line if you wish your heart would just stop beating.
RT : 10 years later, will you still be mine?
RT : ": 10th. "
RT : funny how someone treat you good and then the next moment cold
RT : i miss you so much, so much.
😔😔😔
RT : i don't wanna lose you
RT : ": ": Just ONCE. 😢 " &lt;&lt;"
RT : You still make me smile, even if you are the main reason why I'm sad.
RT : 
RT : that sad moment when changes in messages start to occur... 
RT : I hear receiving the silent treatment from a #Pisces feels like being stabbed in the heart with a ice sickle
One day.. I will be .... .
There's still huge part of me can't pull through..
RT : I miss you, but I'd rather not bother you.
RT : It sucks when you know they are plenty of more fish in the sea, but you only want the one you cant net. #Pisces thought
RT : When ignored by that person whose attention means the most to you, the reaction in your brain is similar to physical pain.
RT : When a person dies, they have 7 minutes of brain activity left. It's the mind playing back the person's memories in a dream seque…
But please don't forget me..
RT : Admit it, you care about someone who probably doesn't care about you.
Still a total darkness for me...
 why😤😤
RT : I want our relationship to be like Tom and Jerry. No matter how many times we fight, we won't be apart.
RT : No one notice your tears, No one notice your sadness, No one notice your pains, But they all notice your mistakes.
RT : Psychology says, the person you care about the most can literally shatter your confidence with their opinions.
RT : You’re the type I don’t wanna lose.
RT : i love you for a thousand more years.
RT : oh i'm all alone with the demons, and i seem to lose.
RT : Sometimes the person who made you stronger, is also your greatest weakness.
RT : Texting the same person all day &amp; night and never getting bored &gt;
RT : Do you? 
RT : Am I that easy to be forgotten and replaced?
