Why are flies coming to my computer desk? Leave me alone!
 Why hate MME? So fun! Animate and draw stuffs, just that the coding may be tough. Don't say that man. And yeah too sudden..
RT :  not this? 
 LOL FK U
When your parents are around and your siblings annoy you 
 But still damn stress about which specialization i should take, both seems quite ok to me. Haha, you put MME or networking?
 It's ok, we can do better than them during exams! Make them go Networking instead hehe. Let's go!
KFC's bucket rice is great,
 Yaaaaa. But I think most of us will be thrown to Networking, trust me. 90% of J class chose MME, and their results are better.
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken~
 Hahaha yeah. Just study hard! Half way through the journey already. Hopefully MME has slots for us though. Easy module,
