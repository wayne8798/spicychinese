不要因為別人的惡語而阻止自己前進，讓自己無法進步是很愚笨的舉動。你不需要為別人負責任，你需要為自己負責任。當你因為別人批評你而停留腳步時不要忘了其實你已經失去很多與你擦身而過的東西。這種責任，你必須自己承擔
 come, chat with me

你知道人為甚麼不會進步嗎？就是總是覺得自己其實沒有到太差的程度。有一個人說：「你也沒有很胖」然後我們就會覺得自己還可以吃還可以懶還可以這樣放肆。但是我們忘了那個人只是說沒有很胖，並不是說我們瘦。在他們的立場她們可能出自安慰，或者他們是少數覺得我們不胖的。要進步就要會自卑和自量
 having class? Hahaha I'm home already
什麼都不比別人好，就註定輸人一輩子

一早起來就看見小baby被強姦的照片，實在是很心疼，什麼都不懂根本沒有成長的寶寶也要遇到這種問題。我很不明白社會到底怎麼了，為甚麼可以那麼變態去強姦baby？真的流淚了，ba by一定很痛很痛但是她只能哭著。。。
