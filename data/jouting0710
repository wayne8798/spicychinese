One day,you'll just be a memory to some people.Do your best to be a good one.
总是要等到每次主动的那一方快放弃了,累了,另一方才会开始在乎.
You cannot be good enough for everybody,but you will always be the best for then one who deserves you.

Cherish those who you have in your life because you never know when they won't be around anymore.
Sometimes,you have to move on without certain people.If they're meant to be in your life,they will catch up.
 exam is coming. Take care.
Be careful who you trust and tell your problems.Not everyone that smiles at you is your friend.
 JIO
如果一个人真的足够在乎你,那么他总能挤出时间来陪你,没有借口,谎言,没有不兑现的诺言.
 So shyyyyyy.Hahahahaa
When you care for someone more than they deserve,you get hurt more than you deserve.
 Where got loo.Ni da bian lahh.HAHAHA
No matter how many things you did for a person.  It's still not a licensed for you to hurt a person and treat them the way you wanted.
 Ming ming jiu hen xiang wo maa.Bu yao jia jia lah.Hahaha
 Ni you xiang wo ma? :D

Boring holiday.
Growth is painful.Change is painful.But nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong.

 Happy Birthday! :D
You don't need someone to complete you.You just need someone to accept you completely.
 Tomorrow spotcheck?
People can say they care,but it means nothing until they prove it.
God knows who belongs in your life and who doesn't. Trust and let go. Whoever is meant to be there, will still be there.
死党就是那群即便知道你傻,还跟着你一起犯傻的人.
Don't change so people will like you. Be yourself and the right person will love the real you.
 Diam lah.Result so good.
结如果真的打不开,就给它系成个花样儿,生活就是这样.
Bad things are always going to happen in life.People will hurt you,but you cant use that as an excuse to hurt someone back.
Don't judge people.You never know what kind of battle they are fighting.
RT : Better to be hurt by the truth than to be protected by lies
当你发现东西已经不如从前,但却无法改变.
I didn't change,you just never knew me.

女孩要嫁的不是王子,而是把你当公主的人.
RT : No girl wants a guy who flirts with everyone.
If you spend too long holding on to the one who treats you like an option,you'll miss finding the one who treats you like a priority.

@WanChing5 Yupp.Hahahaaa

別忘了現在的心乾情怨,全都是當初的心甘情願.
Nobody can go back and start a new begining, but anyone can start now and make a new ending.
HOPE-Hold On,Pain Ends.
Falling in love is like giving someone a gun and letting them point it at your heart but trusting them not to pull the trigger.
@narutochek 睁大眼睛好好看.Lol.

Walaoo.GG.
Don't waste your time to get people to love you.Spend your time with those who already do.

The truth hurts but lies worse.
