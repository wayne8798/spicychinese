因为我已经无药可救了
My eyelids are droppinggg.....
I am an exhausted kid today
The most agonizing moment when even your closet family member do not support you
Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting another person to die. -Buddha
我需要一个可以让我依靠的山
Sometimes I need to cry it all out. I need to unbottle my emotions.
Some people have to learn to be humble. Just because they are at the top of the hierarchy doesn't mean they do the job better than others.
I wonder how I am going to survive this year without laughter and happiness. All I want to do is to sleep.
To the teacher who accused me this morning and I acted as if it was okay 
The only lesson that I look forward to every day is math. Life has become so lifeless. 😔
I HaTe my chem teacher!!! I cannot stand her bossiness and her random accusations on students
I want to be very very skinny
My stomach is dying here but I DONT CARE
I am serious. They ask brainless questions which are UNRELATED to me and I am like wts
I think some people's EQ is negative
Drain yourself mentally and physically to have a good night's sleep
School is fun if you stay with the right people who make your day positive
It's a sleepless Christmas night.
Exactly the reason why I love Leessang 
I admit the my mind is full of rubbish sometimes:( I seriously need to clear my brain
When the guilt settles in.... :(
Things I'm going to do later:
1. Do my math hw 
2. Practice my 🎻
3. Read my 📖
4. Exercise~ 💪🏃
I think my mother saw what I did. I hope don't suspect anything. Sigh.
Entangled in a warp of truth and lies. I am a confused soul.
The passion is chained with sturdy iron locks — unable to be expressed, unable to add colours of the beauty of the world.
**calming the mind
I wonder if daily therapies for the soul helps in calming the kind
I want some wisdom, and hence, I borrowed some books from the library just now
I want an iron shield that protects my tender soul from people's insensitivity
Some people just pisses me off. Do thy realise that their words are like thorns that pricks the heart of people with tender hearts?
It's okay, I worked hard for the exams, just accept everything, because results do not matter
I want a nice talk with my friends and go out and chill
I'm so scared, I need some kind of comfort
Damn angry now
I'm gonna prove that I can score well
It is only that moment then I get scolded psh
:(
Your existence in my life is temporarily blocked by my brain. No longer exist in my life. I'm sorry.
I'd been suffering from the hurt for more than 12 hours
You've hurt me beyond repair.
My head hurts again
Am I really that hopeless in socializing skills
My head is throbbing like mad
My body doesn't feel right today. I feel like a blob of fat and a pig
Concentrate on completing your studies.
Should I keep a diary to record down events of my life? It can be very meaningful in the future
Artificial person... Don't even try to talk to me
Feeling a little guilty inside for eating snacks just now. Hope it doesn't contribute to my weight.
A sudden outburst of anger overwhelmed me just now, and I had to use classical music to suppress and ease it.
希望在这几个小时内能脱离现实。我恨不得把所有烦恼永永远远地抛进大海里，让它们淹没到海地、被鱼儿们当营养吃，以后都不会再使我感到沮丧、失落。
Things I'm going to so tmr:
1. Stretch and breathe
2. Pack up
3. Charge my phone
4. Learn new vocabulary
A list of things I would like to do:
1. Learn 🇰🇷 language
2. Improve my chess, Chinese and English language
3. Practice my 🎹 and 🎻
I feel a pressing need to improve on my writing skills. I want to feel ready to impress my peers and teachers.
That feeling of unproductiveness is messing up my hormones and brain cells. I can't live without a productive day. 

#distressed
I'm stopping myself from tweeting in my true account for no reason. Perhaps I'm just an angst teenager.
I'm sorry I have not gone to that extent of maturity. I. Can't.
I can't.

Music is not helping me today.

I'm so stressed.

#stressed #distressed #teenager #FirstWorldProblems
I'm tired, but I can't sleep. I am keeping myself awake for no reason. I feel so left out. I think my friends are judging me. #distressed
I'm so tired, but I do not feel like sleeping.
J.S. Bach's Art of Fugue BVW 1080 ❤❤❤
今天感觉音乐是神圣的；它总能让我感到被爱
我一定能战胜星座的预告的。。。人生不能活在星座之中，人是可以自己控制自己的命运的。。。
我付出最大努力，因为我不想对不起自己
真的好怀念在欧洲度过那冰天雪地的情景... 
Just pen down everything you feel. Write about the mood, tone, choice of words, literary devices, metaphors and describe them :)
Just had a really nice practice on the violin. #violin
Can't really describe my feelings now... A little empty and a tinge of joy and gratefulness :')
Leaving myself alone, thinking about things and feeling the emotions.
有得必有失。到底要是去哪一个？
Grabbing the motivation from peer pressure. Don't know whether this is the best way to do it.
Success depends on failure. So if there's no failure, there's no success.
Face it with all your energy and all your might. Because 失败乃成功之母, and failure does not represent failure in life
Don't pretend you don't know me. I think you are acting to look as if you are oblivious to the world.
I miss you dear. Sigh. Don't know whether that's you in the bus stop (or it could be your doppelgänger) Let's meet again.
And see what magic happens during the ride
One day I need to take the public transport home
Music cures my emotional wounds. #music #emotions
Being consciously watchful of my words when I tweet...
A friend is not a true friend when she does not uphold upright or moral values, or who is easily influenced my peer pressure
Oceans give me a sense of belonging to the nature but at the same time, a sense of uncertainty. 
A friend is not a true friend when she does not uphold upright or moral values, or who is easily influenced my peer pressure #TrueFriends
Viewing people's ideology can determine whether that person can be a true friend
Come on, wear the shoes of people and walk around in them BEFORE judging people
You don't know how it feels like to start revision weeks earlier so as to copy down every single word in the notes
You don't know how it feels to be like to be a kinesthetic learner.
Went for CCA EXCO interview today. Although it is crappily done, whether I get into EXCO doesn't really matter now. :)
I should finish all my homework by this week
the war
People are studying really hard now. I feel that this holidays are not wasted, because I have taken a good break and fully prepared to fight
I know I must treasure my friends and classmates now. Cherish every moment with them, and be myself because right here, no one judges me. ❤
It pricks my heart when something like this happens. At least, now I feel how it is like to be abandoned.
So bored during tuition... Another 2 hours and 40 minutes more :(((
I don't know how much you know about me and you don't know how much I know about you.
I cannot afford to trap myself in this little bubble even when I am at home. This makes me more introvert.
Confident because I am already doing well in these subject and unconfident because I didn't study enough #admitted
Two papers that I am the most and yet the least confident tmr
Nobody knew I such a dreamy person who tries to be as quiet as a church mouse in front of people
Is that a mask that you are putting on the conceal your uncertainty towards me and my actions
