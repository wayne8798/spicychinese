After 11pm gimme play GTA hor, my turn liao hor😠 
Need a phone with 500% battery.
Why can't we live the life we want, the care-free life we've always wanted and just be happy?
These are the lines that you'd never read, the words that you'd never get to hear anymore.
I only listen to songs that speak my heart.
Hearts are often broken by words left unspoken.
希望这样你会比较开心吧。。。

Waking up to a plate of sashimi in the fridge is the best feeling ever.

Lan lan siao siao, get out of my comfort zone clean wound apply cream.
Sharp pain in the nose and next thing i know, the bleeding has already gone through 4 layers of gauze *Ughhh*
This nose has to stop bleeding all of a sudden, especially when I'm about to go to bed now.
Wtf i play GTA until i didn't know it's gonna be 6am soon, die.
Maybe we should stop focusing on the happy ending but the story instead.
One day at a time.
Goal for 2014 is to accomplish the goals of 2013 which i should've done in 2012 because i promised them in 2011 and planned in 2010.
A place with nothing but bitter sweet friendship memories with the girls.

Do you know how to spell heartbreak? Y O U.
I want to redo my life, re-meet my friends, re-make my choices, maybe then i wouldn't be so stupid.
 Too tired to hold on, too in love to let go?
I'll break you the same way you broke me.
Have you ever counted the number of times you cried while typing 'I'm okay.'?
 Bad times doesn't always last. Moreover, losing someone who doesn't appreciate you is actually your gain, not loss😉
 This love revenge will only come from someone hurt to the bones 😞
Ughhh holy crap, my stitches bleeding A G A I N 😖
Be happy that i want your presence instead of some other guy.
Packing my wardrobe and realize i've got 29 undies. HAHAHAHAHAHHA WTF?

Worrying does not take away tomorrow's troubles, it takes away today's peace.
Just because he says sweet things to you doesn't mean you should let your guard down, always protect your heart.

The scary thing about dating is that you're either gonna marry that person or break up.
 我没事，放心😉
Sometimes you have no choice but to just move on.
Can we be strangers again? Can we start all over? Can we create new memories again?
You'll never ever get to know brcause I'll never ever tell.
能听见你的声音我就心满意足了。
The voice that i missed, so much more than you'll ever know.
I wish i could ignore you like how you ignore me.
You said you'd never leave. Funny, because you fucking left.
Walao craving for the curly wurly fries🍟
I still prefer using line than whatsapp.
You shoot me down, but i won't fall.
You'll never see what's inside of me.
The walls i put up is not to keep people out, but to see who cares enough to knock them down.
We all have stories we won't ever tell.
Let just keep things as silent as can be. 有些事不必说得太明.
Believe me, i will be stronger when i let you go.
Know what i desperately need now? Cigarettes.
Please don't tell me you'll be there whenever i need you...

Because i couldn't sleep, your words fucking affected me the whole fucking night.
Whatsapp: Blocked // Line: Blocked // Phone call: Added to reject list
Headache ah ughhh!
Spmetimes, two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together.
"就算寂寞，分手也不要做朋友。"
Hate myself for letting you be a big part of my life.
Wa why i so purposely?
Still wishing you didn't walk out of that door.
Your 2014 resolution? Just go spend your 2014 continue eating the make up you left from 2013 so you'll be prettier on the inside this year.
If you want the rainbow, you must first learn to put up with the rain.
It's not the changes we take, it's the choice we make that determines our destiny.
Nua too much at home already, need to get a job soon.
