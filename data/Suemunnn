RT : Being yourself is the greatest adventure of all 
RT : The moment when you realize someone actually remembers what you've said or what you've told them. It's really touching. ☺️
  okay okay want !! (:

When im scared of pain, i always tell myself there's nothing to be fear of, because i have experienced something worse than physical pain.
 omg yessss ikr !
 NO :( thats my forever dream T.T
Just realized i had a cut. Didnt feel the pain. Maybe because there's something else that hurts more.
 yessss so true !
RT : 累了 。
How i feel, can also be based on what i see, what i hear, what i know. not just my own assumptions.
RT : have u ever have the urge to send this? 😔 
When im drunk, i'll have the guts to ask
如果什么都能说，这是一种解脱。
RT : 有些情绪是该说给懂的人听
If i can really really really tell you anything, i guess i'll be much much better now. Is it possible first ?
Is never me anymore.
They say forget and forgive. I can never forget, i guess i cant forgive.
A bad day. A bad mood. All alone. Just too great 👍
曾經的我，現在的妳
Who am i to ask such a question
忍住眼泪不让它流下
好的事情最後雖然結束

Anyone watched 赌城风云？
那樣的回憶 那麼足夠
足夠我天天都品嘗著寂寞
從何開始，和你對話我變得如此小心翼翼
Should I tell ? Yes ? No ?
原来我最执着的，其实你从来都不在乎的 :(
一刹那的兴奋，而已
Keep the memories, because ppl change, but memories never fade.
When you are busy but still thinking of something, you know how much that thing is affecting you.
 I feel you too 😢
RT : That feeling when you realize everything has changed.
Seems that 一路有你 is nice. maybe i should watch (:
RT : 心里的感受，又有谁能够理解呢..
RT : Sometimes you just have to sacrifice in order to achieve what you want 😊
Every time i force myself to do things that i know will make me sad. Stupid enough.
RT : 我還傻傻等到奇蹟出現的那一天
RT : Always be yourself cos nobody in this world does you better than you. Why be a copy when you can be an original?
要飛得高，要走得遠，就要大膽嘗試。怕，永遠就輸。

Sometimes i wonder, am i just your toy ? or not even qualified to be a toy. lol.
說沒事的，就是最有事的那個。
感觉就像被高高举起，然后被狠狠丢下。
RT : Why not u just tell me what happened or how you feel. Be straight forward.
RT : One of the things I regret most, is taking you for granted..
我却还在原点，原来没有放下过 -.-
时间过得真快，一个月就这样过去了
RT : 了解知道事实后心必定会受伤，但还是很想确认是否是自己想得太多..

“: how I feel playing flappy bird ”  hahahaha that stupid game
Flappy bird -.-
It taught me a lesson. Learn to appreciate, you never know when will you lose it
谁说后悔了就能挽回失去的
第一次真的有那种，后悔了却不能重来过的感觉。错过太多了。
RT : The smallest things 
RT : i used to get so excited whenever this pops out esp if it's someone i really want to talk to 
How i wish you can read my mind, and know whats playing in there :(
A bad night.
Even when your heart break into pieces, pick up the pieces and move on
No matter how hard i control, i still fail :(
RT : 我现在明白快乐是那么的短暂…
当彼此保持沉默，但感情不会变淡，这一定是真正的友情。
you feel like talking, but you dont know what to talk about, and you know how this can annoy ppl :/
CNY coming soon, I should be happy, shouldnt I ?
RT : 时间总会让你看清最不想面对的现实。
How to stop thinking ? :(
我欠最多人情的就是他们两个了

懂你的人，会了解你眼泪背后的故事；不懂你的人，只会觉得你爱哭。
 要疯了，就快
Feel so not good now. I think i will die in class tmr.
what can hurt me most is that when i thought you will be the one who understands me, you turn out being the opposite :(
RT : I would rather die protecting the things I love than regretting not making an effort and continue living.. Cause they are all…
梦里的那一幕，我还记得很清楚。你不知道，我有多害怕有一天那一幕会在现实生活中成真 :(
有没有那么一个朋友，是不管什么心情的时候都可以找的，不是要帮我解决问题，只想有个精神支柱。
寂寞的感觉，真的很难熬。
那一次，刺得太深，至今那根次刺还在心里。忘不了那种痛。
最好的都留给最好的朋友
RT : 最好的朋友，平时互相调侃，是嘴最狠的那个。在你需要的时候，却是心最软的那个。
有时傻傻地去做，傻傻地去相信，你会发现自己快乐很多。
Gonna be a tough day 👊
Ahhhh T.T
 awww your bro so good (:

RT : ": Friends " 
RT : 对的那条路，往往不是最好走的。
