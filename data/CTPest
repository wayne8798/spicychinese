sniff.
For a while this felt like the old days.  :'(
 

Why does that sound so true?
 
1) Do you go on deviantart?
2) You have a membership card bah, lol
 
sorry am I spamming you? &gt;&lt;
 I'm sure you go on deviantart right?
 
eg. Naruto = Naruto fandom.  This also applies to ships.
 
Oh I see. Fandom basically means.... you know kingdom? Fandom is like for people who like that show.
 Let me make another wild guess: You have a membership card. Rich girl.  :3
 
You draw? Or write? Just curious. When you see works of art in your fandom, do you ever feel inferior? &gt;&lt; o.o
 
I see. Nice place isn't it? :)
Thanks for sharing. Much appreciated.
 
 Oh, I thought you read FanFiction. You seem like one who does. &gt;&lt;
Time has passed us by.

Hehe. I suppose you go there often? Again, just asking. Curious as to how many people 'round me frequent that place.
Maybe I was too specific.

Losing Your Memory by Ryan Star
Let's conduct an experiment.
more of written
 
Like ATLA merchandise, ATLA events are usually in the states 'cuz 1) it was made there 2) lots of long-life Avatards there
 Yup. The Avatar poster was given out at the Nick booth at SDCC 2012. It was in the states if I'm correct.
 
heard*
 I'm sure you head about the Old Friends and New Friends poster they gave out at Comic Con or something.
 
RT :  well my parents will disagree too :'/ sobs
 
I know it's kind of nerdy but I really WANT THIS IN MY ROOMM!!!!!!!!!!!!1
 
they also have this poster encouraging reading. In the states they actually put this in libraries. &gt;&lt; sigh here nothing&gt;&lt;
 BUT THEY DON'T SELL IT IN SG SOBS SOBS WHY SINGAPORE WHY? &gt;&lt;Unless we buy online, which my Dad will obviously say no./shrug
 

And this is only one out of the many &gt;&lt;
 
They have this giant, huge Appa soft toy. &gt;&lt; :)
 
One problem. &gt;&lt; We now know where to get ATLA books. But how about other ATLA merchandise?!?!EWIUN#@*(_%Y@( soft toy!&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;!
RT :  I MISS APPA LOL
RT :  YES I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL 8D
 
 LOL YEAH LET'S DO IT!! YIP YIP xD
 

HAHA ^^  I just love this show, so much.  #ForeverOkay?  &lt;333
 I'll prefer not to spoil it for you. &gt;&lt; :)
 
IT'S OKAY HEHE LOL LOL
 
I mean, I have (kind of) grown to care about the show, enough to be curious about it's political system. &gt;&lt; :)
 
Though, I'm kind of sad they excluded that politics part in the beginning. &gt;&lt; :? :/
 
So how was the Search? :) ^^

THE KATAANG MOMENTS. THE FEELS.. AWWWW &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;
 
I'm guessing you meant "OBJECTION!"
 
hehe same &gt;&lt;
 
and XIN RAN ASNAO[E9PR0MVQ32U-V2Q!Q#$#
 
I have a feeling you're going to love the art book. You're an artist yourself. ^^
 
 I think the price has dropped a little bit now. So good news for you. :)
 OH YEAH I JUST REMEMBERED ANDREA!! ^^
 
But anyways they're still there. ^^
