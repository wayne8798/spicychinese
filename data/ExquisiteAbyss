Please don’t hold your pride higher than me.
Don’t teach me that I’m the kind of person you need a break from. Love me all the time or not at all, I’m too fragile to be left on pause.
You don't get to choose when to have me; you can't turn me off like loud music.
"Are you really threatening me with a hair brush?" He asked, still laughing a little. "What are you going to do? Brush my hair to death?"
RT : i'll pay any cost, save me from being confused.
They don’t kill you unless you light them. You put the killing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing.
Was that insensitive? I can be pretty blind to other people’s feelings.
To choose from there were many; among them, there were some. And of those I loved you, more than any— but not as much as one.
I hope someday you will find me and remember what I once meant to you.
Everything that we once were, is now a sad and lonely verse. It's not as if you would have stayed, if I hadn't left you first.
I cannot undo what I have done, and the saddest thing about my regret— I can't forgive me, and you can't forget.
“Do you love me?” I ask. In your hesitation I found my answer.
I turn away and close my heart— to the promise of love that is luring.
Slowly I am withering— a flower deprived of sun; longing to belong to— somewhere or someone.
To love him is something, I hold highly suspicious. Like having something, so very delicious— then being told, to do the dishes.

I'm done playing by your rules, it's my turn now. Either accept it or fuck off.
I gave you a chance, after all that I did, just a little something to prove my importance. You fucking failed.
": I gave so much that I lost myself in the process."
Don't blame me when I start making things ugly and do things you don't like, remember you were the one who made me.
If this is how you choose things to be, then fine, I accept it.
": Really miss the feeling of being pampered &amp; doted on...... 😔"

It takes two hands to clap, but I'm like a fool clapping alone.
": I don't know why i'm crying so badly right now. It fucking hurts."
Silly me to think that I could trust you again.
I can't believe it, once again my tears are dropping for you. I thought I was over all your bullshit and nonsense, why now.
": And they say pain and heartbreak make you wise, but I feel more empty."
It's like a cycle, a book being read over and over again, the same ending replaying nonstop. It's time to put an end to this.
": “: I feel that you're just placing everything above me.”"
Pmsing so badly and everything pisses the fuck out of me. It's like I want someone to be here with me, yet I feel like killing everybody.
After all, the guy who doesn’t prioritize you now is NEVER going to prioritize you.
It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free.

我给你最後的疼爱是手放开
I used to wonder if it even makes a difference to try but now I see it all too clearly, nothing changes.
It really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you. Give me something to believe in, cause I don't believe in you anymore.
Yeah I'm real emotional, blame it on your mental jokes. How much did you think that I could take? So much for taking this too far.
I won't let you use me anymore. I won't let you string me along anymore.
选择放弃去猜你每一个反应, 去猜你是否变心.
一个人闷得发慌。谁懂得我的疯狂，谁会一直在我的身旁。一个人不可能有多快乐我承认。从前是两个人多认真，一年后却像两个陌生人。
你没反抗是因为我不够坚强
泪流下 那么荒唐 分手当初是我在逞强
Insecurities, low self esteem and 0 confidence. No wonder people always leave. No wonder I've started leaving people before I am left.
Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tried. Tired.
He who cannot unveil himself cannot love, and he who cannot love is the unhappiest one of all.
If I will it, can I un-feel it, now I've felt it?
": My answer last time will be i still love him. But now i can say that yes im letting go."
": I don't see the point being nice to you anymore."

I want love. Or death. That’s it.
 Negative meh? Ohhh is it? But now okay already, means god telling me to go?
RT :  god and fate telling u something.
 Smlj? Ya, telling me don't contact you right? :)
 disgusting. Just having the courtesy to let you know, unlike you.
Wtf my phone suddenly crash, can't even on this stupid shit at all.
 oi. my phone crash, cannot on at all.
Wtf. Only when you receive noti from my twitter and it's something that you don't like, then you will reply my text. smlj is this.
Sometimes you promise someone forever but it doesn't work out that way.
I'm sorry I can't see that you truly love me.
I will never let myself believe someone really loves me.
half of the time it feels like you are here to destroy me
I'm sorry, it's just that I literally do not care at all.
Does it frustrate you that I finally learnt how to play your game? :)
you told me that you wanted this; i told you it was all yours; if you wanted don’t want it, then what’d you say forever for…
Happiness does not seem to be on the menu, so smoke up.
The cruelest thing of all is false hope.
There isn't one thing left you could say, I'm sorry it's too late.
I finally can breathe..
The fears that once controlled me can't get to me. I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve, the past is all behind me,
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
I’m done trying. I’m gonna do what I do best; giving up.
Your words mean nothing, it does no effect to me. In fact, I'm pretty amused.

Out I go. #Tgif #Ootn 
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go.
This love will be the death of me, but I know I will die happily.
Forever is a long time, but I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
I came out and saw a box of cupcakes at the staircase with lighted candles on it and he just popped out of nowhere and hugged me. Awww.
He booked out early, though we quarreled, he traveled all the way down from Clementi. He called me to say he left something outside my house
Suddenly remembered a surprise I received from A last year, though it wasn't Valentines. It wasn't much, but it was like pretty sweet.
Hey idiot I love you
intoxicated with madness, I'm in love with my sadness.
