世界没有悲剧和喜剧之分，如果你能从悲剧中走出来，那就是喜剧，如果你沉缅于喜剧之中，那它就是悲剧。

不要瞧不起那些看似荒诞的民间思想家们，也许一个新的“相对论”就在他们丑陋的意淫中诞生了，而你却自以为是上帝去嘲笑他，就向当初那些嘲笑爱因斯坦的一百多个知名科学家，科学精神不仅仅是实证与逻辑，更是包容与宽容。
没有能源，现代社会就陷入危机，没有医疗，人的健康就无从保障，相比社会公正与人权，它们就不那么重要了，记住一个科学家，首先是一个民主人士，否则他对社会就是危险品。
如果你是为了吃饭来进入大学深造，那么请去肯德基当店员，真理的获取不是仅仅为了吃饭。
要明白什么是学习，人的生命是短暂的，你不可能经历所有的精彩，学习是帮助你梳理你未曾经历过的精彩，所以学习显得尤为重要，但生活的真实存在更重要，记住任何理论都是偏执，所以请学习理论，但也同时怀疑理论，因为上帝比你更聪明，真实比理论更全面，

不管你有再多的兴趣爱好，再多的社会关系，再深的对努力学习的厌恶之感。在你青春期的某一个时间点，你都会明白，学习的重要性高过所有。你要无欲则刚，你要学会孤独，你要把自己逼出最大的潜能，没有人会为了你的未来买单；你要么努力向上爬，要么烂在社会最底层的泥淖里。这就是生活。
常常不明白为什么每天要这样的生活着，似乎是因为大家都这样，所以也就这样了，连拒绝和反抗都没有就接受了。每天回到家里，躺在床上，莫名的空虚蔓延开来。内心有一个声音在嘶吼着，我不快乐，我不喜欢现在的生活。带着疲惫入睡，第二天起来生活还是如此，如此反复着。
