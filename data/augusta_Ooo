或许我长大了, 懂了什么叫现实
Thiis is the last time. I would not offer any second chance.
One day you will miss the call and the message.
因为用嘴巴说很简单, 不如你做做看。
单方面的付出是会累的, 如果你只懂得拥有。
不要认为自己厉害过别人,有些事情你也得站在别人的角度去想。
有些事情,我只会问一次, 也就是最后一次。
有些事情, 大人不说 小孩又怎么会知道呢

RT : #True 
Just accept the fact that you never get what you want. have you?
别问我为什么不挽留，因为我不喜欢勉强。
Stay or Leave. You make your own decision. Door is always open but please don't block the way.
No one notice your pain, your tears, your sadness but they notice your mistakes.
I realized, some people are so good at pretending to be nice.
RT : Beauty gets the eyes, but personality gets attention.
RT : Pain changes people.
Pretending to be happy when you are in pain. SUCKS !
I got tired of always the same thing.
When I forgive I heal. When I let go I grow. Thanks dude !

I'm over you 
I'm over you 
I'm over you 
I'm over you 
I'm over you

No matter how loud you shout how hard you try to explain in your heart. No ones gonna hear you.
Im sick of those sorry.
They dont even make an effort.
See i was correct. They will only blame on me

Dont worry you will be okay.
Dont teach me how to do. I have my own way.
Dont expect everybody can be like you.
Im not a saint. I cant forgive easily like how you usually do.
Dont try to show me how perfect you are.
I know where is your level dude. Im just keep my mouth shut.
Stop pointing at me. Solve your own problems.
Im so sick to tell you my pain
You can say sorry as many as you want. But I cant forgive you as many as I can.
Dont expect people treat you like how you treat them. Dont be naive.
My attitude is based on how you treat me. Im just being fair
Here are my new friends ;))

Can't believe that she is my teacher.

While there is life, the fight continues

RT : What a busy night, I find that picking presents for people is harder than solving an addmaths question. 😅
RT : i only accept apologies in cash.
He can just smile at me and say dont worry about it.
Thats all I can do.
Im tired of crying to sleep, letting out all the thibgs that I bottled inside put on a fake smile and forced laugh
Alone. But I will survive
How long its gonna be? Next year? Next day? Or maybe next day?
Don't say forever to somebody if you dont even know what does it mean.
Missing those day when he was here.
As one door close, another one opens.
原谅我的不懂事。
": youre as annoying as an app that turns sideways when you lie down"
RT : youre as annoying as an app that turns sideways when you lie down
I don't chase after anyone if you wanna walk out my life I will hold the fucking door open for you.
I feel lonely all the time
I can't keep my time but I can spend my time
不是认识时间长就可以是好朋友。
And I used to be like that.
They will find you whenever they need you.
They will call your name nicely and talk to  you softly. This is life.
我了解配角的感受。
说好,破晓前忘掉。

Just because I am used to it doesn't mean I don't get hurt… 
Just because I am used to it doesn't mean I doesn't get hurt  anymore.
真的是因为我习惯了,并不代表我就不痛了。
