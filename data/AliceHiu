沿路遇著許多人，譜出每個故事。或喜或悲。只望從中認識、學會更多。我，清楚自己想要什麼。或許，他會愛上今天的我。可是，在我最差勁的日子遇上他。沒關係。我在遇見下個他前，努力增值自己！每天要比昨天進步！這樣，我才有底氣告訴他「我愛你」。因為，我很懂得愛自己！
盤繞不去的問題..
價值？！
如何增加比較優勢
每個人都具價值，或多或少。
如何，增加自己的價值？
做好本份，是必需。
技術？手藝？知識？
Value
I'm afraid..
Have faith. Learn to be strong.
Focus and focus.
Dare to dream and live in own life!
Don't be afraid...
怎麼可以相差那麼多..
我又可以怎樣達到？🙈
世界好大。
所有相遇都是久別重逢。
我們之間沒有恩怨，只有緣分
愛自己...
是好好經營自己人生
是追求更好的靈魂與心情
我  開始懂和自己談戀愛 
假忙碌=真折騰
需要怎麼做？
為什麼要這樣做？
做了會怎樣？
不做，結果會是樣？
反省每天 反悟每週每月
再不斷訂立目標
認識更多人..
更了解自己.更討厭自己
連自己都不愛
Live in RULES =］ 
目標清晰點，注重力集中點，其他事相對而言並不重要！每個人都過著不一樣生活，不同價值觀、立場。
交給時間證明每個決定。 
It seems impossible until it's done.
從來都只能靠自己，別指望任何人打救！
杨幂对唐嫣说：我把我所有的桃花运都给你-我的伴娘！最感动的，伴娘只是唐嫣一个。闺蜜不需要太多，一个真正肯对你好的就够！杨幂和刘诗诗当初那么好，如今也不过一盒喜糖的关系。如果幸运，谁不想一辈子和最初的那个人永远姐妹。友情这东西很脆弱. 
Happy 2014
I miss..😊 
I appreciate for those who still stay after know the real me
I'm much stronger than yesterday

Sweet dreams🌙 
FML
It's suck 
What should I do..
Seems so far away from me..

Lost 
This is real me...
Dare to dream?
You will never achieve anything if you spend your time that way!
Don't think and don't speak
Live in ur own life.alice
There's no need to be rush
Dun bring back all memories..no need to keep in touch.no need to be fd..
到底怎麼回事.到底我是怎樣的人..
為什麼每次都會這樣。
我很失敗，真的很失敗。
Dun think.Just focus and rebuild =]
I'm on my way..
不再執著 緊鎖心房。
請靠近包容這曾受傷被淘空的心
不成熟，以致關係演變成這
我，不值得 
任何人對我好

封閉，自閉
Why so serious..Douche 😌
原來我真的不算什麼
想你想你，只能成為嗜好
自己冧自己，可以撐到多久？
我不是不會懷疑，只是不想再讓自己太累。駝鳥般心態，選擇不去查。看開多點，放過自己。
你信用已破產，我選擇繼續自欺地過日^_^ 何時將會是終結？
有時候，你不作決定也是種選擇。你的沈默，你的逃避，是對我的殘忍。
自遇見你，我再沒能力去愛另一個。我再沒認識任何人。自與你相識，我的腦海中，我的心裡亦只有你。我很感激上天讓我倆相識相遇。原諒我自私，很想霸佔你身旁位置直至這生的最後。我這麼愛你，你感受到麼？會接受嗎？
要傾聽，不是抱怨
要合作，不是攻擊
請別再給我許下任何承諾。守不到的諾言比得不到諾言，更令人難過。每次給予的期望只換來失望。而失望的盡頭，是一顆疲憊的心。我不想倒數，不愛我 請離開我。
From now on,I will expect nothing.i don't care anymore.i wanna rely on but u will never here.
有你，便已足夠。我不需奢華與激情，只求能與你攜手走過細水流長的流年。沿路有你，多大風雨都不怕。請別...看大問題。年齡，只是數字距離；地方，只是空間距離；只有兩心靠近，外界的所有也是虛無飄渺。請別...離我太遠。我唯一的要求，只是要你的愛而已。
Trust u!!clear my mind.dun think too much..just becuz I'm so fucking free and he is too busy.is not a big thing if we dun meet.we changed.
Love u more than I thought.can't imagine live without u.I trust u.

你想帶我去那裡，方向是否已確定？
感情這片奇花異卉的森林，美是很美只怕再次迷路 多傷感情。
的確是很不容易，所以珍惜遇見你。
但 走進我的生命裡，就請像我不貪心。
有了愛的人，請安守己份，別嚮往有更好的。 
不要..傷痕
希望只是我太多胡思亂想.這患得患失的感覺很難受.不安，是源自我不足的勇氣.
really miss u.cant stop thinking of u..sigh when is the end ar....
Right!it's not easy to find someone u love..therefore we need to brave in love...
We dun even know each other.many understand between us.this choice make me doubtfully.Honestly argue in this topic is really childish!!!
Clear my mind again.Love destroying me.
ys.u win..Im loser.認真便輸了*我太天真.我很笨.我竟相信陌生人的話。面皮已抓破.這關係不想再糾纏。真的完了！結束了.曾以為伸手可及誰知竟是夢一場。從來沒有
From now on,I will expect nothing.Just take what I get.Wont regret anything that ever make me smile.
 我已接受*若真是我的，輾轉間還是會遇上。若真有緣，跑不掉。緣來緣去，輪迴千載，只為在對的時間遇見對的人。
RT :  u meet the right person at the wrong timing.
What do I looking for?just follow my heart to make decision.everytime i try to leave sths turn me around.i should be autism.no regret...
So fucking boring.throught Ive already accepted stay alone.do everything by myself.seems not totally......
I know u feel me somehow.i dun want the world to see me cuz they'd not understand.when eth's made to be broken,I just want u know who I am.
我好像不難過.沒感覺般生活。你說控制不了想念我.我的心並沒從前般興奮。我的回覆.你不作回應。我非厚顏無恥的人.我不糾纏。到底..要你說出這番話 是否很容易？為何我好不容易才收拾好心情卻勾起我的心癮？我..真的沒感覺？
Maybe u dun believe the same feeling of me.everyday I try not to think u,every moment I really wanna feel u.its due to timing?history again.
Its over.really over!!i dun deserve u.is all my problem.my fucking self-abased push us away each other.im not as good as u think.im so bad..
Treat myself better.no matter how terrible of life,theres no excuse to become depraved.no one deserve....be who u are.do what u want.
Miss.miss u more than I thought.cant stop thinking of u.you've  been already in my mind.
Dun want to dream,no.
No dream could be as beatiful as u are.Tell me what have I done to deserve this beatiful.Tell me why am I the one u...

Im scared to see the ending why awe pretending this is nothing. Id tell u miss u but i dun know how.ive never heard silence quite this loud.
因為想念 而不知說些什麼
A simple complication,miscommunication lead to fallout,so many things that wish u know,so many walls that I cant break through.
