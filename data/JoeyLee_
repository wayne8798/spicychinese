我是一个有感情的人，无论我有多恨你，你对我做过很不好的东西，可是当我知道你出了事，我还是会关心你，这样会很过分吗？可是你的事我是管不着了的，你自己 ' 拾生 ' 啦。😊😊
The most important thing I like about Samsung is because their battery can last super long 😊😊
Even if I put offline also people can see me online once I open Facebook! 😠😠
你喜欢狗眼看人低我也没办法了，我唯一能做的就是敷衍 😂😂😂
其实我觉得我和你简直是两个世界的人，我根本get不到你的line .. 算了吧，不同channel 是比较难沟通，你将厉害，不要找我这些鱼毛虾仔chat啦。你不辛苦我也幸苦，你拿我来玩咩？
其实你那些的一样东西我都不稀罕 应酬你因为我给你面子罢了 😃😃
我真的分不清你是好人还是坏人 😂😂😂
哎哟 我知道你很厉害啦 不用每天来串我 你不累我都累啦 我才不会重考呢，要我的命咩。 =.=
