In this world, only Anita can feel what I feel. Unfortunately, she passed away. Now, I am the only one left with this kind of feeling...
I guess I am extremely suitable to live in the 90s. This new generation is way too difficult for me to live in...
The existences of my Twitter and Instagram accounts are because of you.
After today's trip to morning market with my mum, I start to believe "love is blind".
Today, I did all the old things, just like old times. It is a wish, a hope, a new restart to our sincerest friendship. :-}
Best in confidence but just first runner-up for creativity. I still unable to be the best of the best.
I guess the next time we meet will be at the school's carnival Miss KP!
Can someone teach me how to communicate with someone who doesn't want to communicate with me? :(

In conclusion of my life at this second, Jason has many unfinished businesses with London.
 Hahaha! Unfortunately, staying isn't suitable for someone also... :/
I should have been to INTI college instead... ~_~
So many of my friends went overseas for studies. They left Malaysia. The more friends leave Malaysia, the more I hate being here!!!
How should one wish a special friend on her birthday?
How am I going to see people during the Chinese New Year with such body?!?!?!?
I can't believe when I look into the mirror, I am so damn fat! College life is so fattening!
A voice of a person is a very important aspect.

It's too late to regret.
Please reply my message! Please!!!
@KimJoonWooX Aiya, don't say la. These three friends are so important to me and I lost them just because of my stupidity! :/
So far of my life, I have lost 3 very important friends.
I may have the least friends among all the people around me but I am proud to say that all my friends are best friends!
Some people just don't deserve to have handsome nor pretty faces 'cause they don't know how to appreciate and make good use of them... #_#
I start to agree with your statement. Someone is getting very arrogant these days!
@KimJoonWooX Just remember what I defined. My definition sounds much better.
@KimJoonWooX "Something that has happened particularly to a person"? That's bullshit!
@KimJoonWooX So, what's destiny?
