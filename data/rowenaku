后悔 的应该是你 不是我。
失去我 是你的损失。
I know, talk to you really makes my day better.
RT : 有时候不是等待就一定会有结果的。
RT : It sucks when you still love the person who broke your heart.
RT : You deserve someone who knows how to make things up to you after hurting you. Not someone who is very good with just the …
There's no difference between I want to leave you or not. But there's a big difference between you want me to stay or you want me to leave.
Let's be a stranger to each other again, like we still don't know each other yet.
“Memories are the only reason we can't move on.”

Can anyone talk with me right now? ...
她放的还是我最喜欢的那一张。
我试着说服自己，说你的心没有我，我却想起了那天早上下着雨你为我撑着伞，那天放学你留给我巧克力，帮我背着书包拿着课本在厕所外面等我。我根本忘不了。
深情是担不起的重担，情话只是偶然兑现的谎言。
如果有下辈子，我一定要做你的心脏，因为我不跳，你就得死。
RT : 吵不散，骂不走，那才叫爱情。 只要结局是跟你在一起，过程让我怎么痛都行。
Everything between us changed. I know, you know. Both of us know it.
Life goes on.. with or without you.
Meow lets me talk with stranger from UK omg
RT : 我讨厌你很长一段时间都忽略我， 然后又突然开始和我说话，好像什么事情也没有发生过一样。
RT : Do you miss me, like I miss you?
RT : 真正的爱情不是一时好感，而是明明知道没结果，还想要坚持下去的冲动。
RT : 我承认我是自私 , 我不喜欢看见你和她在一起。
RT : We used to be close, but now we don't look at each other the same crazy intense way like we used to.
I'm at Tong Hing Supermarket (Damai Plaza) (Kota Kinabalu, Sabah) 
“: You assume I give a damn, that's cute.”
“: I hate this feeling of not knowing what you're feeling..”
RT : The best way to appreciate someone is to imagine your life without them.
RT : It's crazy how when you're really into someone, you don't even notice anyone else.
RT : Nothing hurts more than trying so hard to be good enough and being replaced by someone better.
RT : I wonder how many times we forgive just because we don't want to lose someone. Even if they don't deserve forgiveness.
傻 佬 我 好 想 念 你 啊
Finally we talk 💕
RT : "My mind didn't change, I still feel the same" - Drake
RT : You can't lie to a girl.. You just can't.. She'll find out.

RT : I get jealous over anything.... A hug, a hi, bye, glance, text, phone call, all that shit.
RT : 明明很快乐 却又很悲伤 笑得像小孩 哭得像傻子 安全感怎麼那麼抽象.
只想找一个人疼自己而已 很难吗

RT : Love is the most beautiful thing to have, hardest thing to earn and most hurtful thing to lose.
RT : It is what it is. Accept it and move on.
“: why is this 5 year old boy is hotter than boys at my school ”
自卑还有紧张 是我心中的魔鬼 😂
Friends said that my looks make people think that I have a boyfriend haha wtf?
RT : I fucking trusted you, my mistake.
RT : Why is it when someone wants you, you don't want them, and then when you want them, they don't want you?
RT : Have you ever asked yourself, "when is it my turn to be happy?"
RT : I get jealous because I'm afraid someone is going to make you happier than I do.
RT : Giving up is simply not an option.
“: I almost wish we never met.”
You still need to know what I write for you meh 😂😂
因为你的绝情 我必须学会狠心
This is what you gave me on Valentines Day? Wa. Haha. Nice one. So hurt. Great. Thanks.
You make me feel like I'm a fool.
RT : There comes a point in your life when you realize who really matters, who never did, and who always will.
RT : these drinks look amazing 🍹😍 
RT : 你因为他的一句话生气，自己生了很久的闷气，等着他来哄，也许到最后他根本都不知道自己哪句话说错了。所以我现在明白，沟通一定是最重要的,你生气，你不理他，你哭，只会让他觉得无理取闹，你以为他能明白，你以为他能理解,但是在他们眼里，只会觉得不知所谓。有的事…
RT : 爱，就是没有理由的心疼和不设前提的宽容。
RT : so precious 
女生就是爱无理取闹 你不知道么
Because you thought it wasn't for you so you delete. Stupid oh you.
My mind didn't change. I still feel the same.
Valentines Day with friends 😂 
I'm at Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) - @gscinemas (Kota Kinabalu, Sabah)

I really don't know how to reply you
RT : nak sorang 
叫你不要理 你就真的不理 😂
Because I cant give you what you want. So I leave you.
RT : 暧昧永远都没有爱情重要; 请记得, 如果一个人真正的爱你, 是不会和别人暧昧的。暧昧只能填补内心一时的空虚, 是不会长久的, 是有百害而无一利。一份美好的爱情, 容不下一丁点的欺骗和虚伪, 更容不下的是暧昧。拥有了爱情, 就别去碰暧昧。
RT : 有一种爱, 明明是深爱, 却表达不完美。有一种爱, 明知道要放弃, 却不甘心就此离开。有一种爱, 明知是煎熬, 却又躱不掉。有一种爱, 明知无前路, 心却早已收不回来。
RT : It's safe to say I'm not a fan of Valentine's Day at all.
RT : Dear heart 
一万次 那该有多痛
Something really happened.
哭出来会舒服点 c:
Is that really hard to answer my question?

RT : this is insanely relevant right now. 
RT : 要我怎样装得好像什么事都没有发生
RT : I hate when people bring up old shit.
RT : 我不喜欢我不喜欢的人喜欢我喜欢的人。
RT : 我希望你是我的 我一个人的
RT : “Never let your feelings get too deep, people can change at any moment.”
RT : 你还在想着那个人么？其实，一件事，就算再美好，一旦没有结果，就不要再纠缠，久了你会倦，会累；一个人，就算再留念，如果抓不住，就要适时放手，久了你会神伤，会心碎。
我还爱着你，只是少了想在一起的执着
你可以沉默不语，不管我的着急；不回信息，不顾我的焦虑；将我的关心，说成让你烦躁的原因；把我的思念，丢在角落不屑一顾。对着其他人微笑，给别人拥抱，对全世界好，却忘了我一直的伤心。你不过是仗着我喜欢你，而那却是唯一让我变得卑微的原因。 
累得想睡却还失眠 爱得太累却心太软
Let's end before Valentines Day.
RT : If it's meant to be, it will be, don't force it.

RT : #truth 💯💯💯 
You are my Panda, you are mine.
我 快 要 疯 了

Nightmare. The scariest thing happened in my dream
RT : 付出真心，才会得到真心，却也可能伤得彻底；保持距离，就能保护自己，却也注定永远寂寞。
RT : 一旦心碎了 , 伤心的又是自己。
RT : 每天想起他曾经为我做过的一件事就足以让我开心了 😝

“: When the person I like is talking to me. 😍😲 ”
Don't try to treat me like you did before. Please? You're gone, since that day. And I don't need you in my life anymore
RT : 82% teens don’t ring the doorbell. They text or call to say they’re outside
RT : 心情不好的时候，我只想一个人安安静静的待着。不求安慰，只求有人能懂。
That's how I feel your love teehee ❤️
He doesn't need me.
I won't let you bring me back to the past, to those memories that I wanted to forget.
I will be grateful.
Don't pretend like you still care about me.
I can't hate you. And I can't forget you completely. But I sure that I wont love you again. c;
