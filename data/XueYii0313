RT : feeling sad? 
Someone will always be prettier. Someone will always be smarter. Someone will always be younger. But they will never be me.
Life is so much better when you stop caring about what everyone thinks, and start to actually live for yourself!!
Every day, I think about texting you but then, I think "if you really wanted to talk to me, you'd text me first.
I've learned that you know you're in love when you want to tell everyone about it, even if they haven't asked.
 上半年而已，下半年你就不会觉得轻松了 ==
New highscore. ✌️ 
Never be afraid to try something new, because life gets boring when you stay within the limits of what you already know.
I'm scared of looking at you because the more I do, the more I fall in love with you.
It doesn't matter who hurt you or broke you down, what matters is who made you smile again.
'I love you' means loving you when you're in a bad mood or too tired to do things I want to do.
Don't waste your time on revenge. The people who hurt you will eventually face their own karma.
I wanna be the one your ex will hate, your mom will love and the one you'll never forget. 😍👌💏
One of the best feelings is when someone understands you without you having to say anything.
I get jealous because I love you, and I don't want anyone else to have you.
Every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is if you still want to be together when things go wrong.
Don't compare yourself to others, you are you. No one could come close to being you even if they tried.
Feelings that come back are feelings that never went away in the first place.

Eventually all things fall into place. Until then, laugh at the confusion, live for the moments, and know everything happens for a reason.
RT : Let's do this 👯 
I hate the fact that you ignore me for so long, then you start talking to me like nothing happened.
Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people and their negativity.
There is always a lesson to be learned. Don't let your pride get in the way of learning it.
Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you.
Never compare yourself to someone else. The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday.
With you, I can forget all my problems. With you, time stands still. With you, there's no one else.
In the end you'll know who's fake.. who's true.. and who will risk it all for you..
Nothing lasts forever. I think that's the easiest lesson we all learn the hardest way.
喜欢就争取，得到就珍惜，错过就忘记。生活其实就这么简单，是我们自己把它搞复杂了。使一切变复杂的，是我们无休止的欲望。因为欲望，一切得到的不再珍贵，一切得不到的才是好的。人心何时懂得知足，何时才能迎来幸福。
I wonder how it feels to actually have someone that won't leave you or take you for granted.
I finally found my passion to have an essay writing 😊 
 he have so many ANTI's loh...
Sometimes I hate getting close to people because I think they will just eventually walk out of my life no matter how close we are.
Sometimes what you want isn't always what you get, but in the end, what you get is so much better than what you wanted.
Sometimes, change may not be what we want, but it's what we need in order to grow.
A relationship with no trust is like a car with no gas. You can stay in it, but it won't go anywhere.
RT : why do teachers think i have enough time between emotional breakdowns to do homework
RT : 👍👌 
Just because I'm crying, doesn't mean I'm sad. Sometimes it means I'm tired of pretending to be strong.
If you want to know where your heart is, look where your mind goes when it wanders.
To be honest, I really don't give a fuck. I lose friends, make friends and make enemies everyday. Regardless, I'm still going to be me.
  sure , I didn't ask Justin to listen to me orz
Don't waste words on people who deserve your silence. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can say is nothing at all.

Someone will always be prettier. Someone will always be smarter. Someone will always be younger. But they will never be you.
That moment when you and your crush look at each other at the same time and smile.
Don't compare yourself to others, you are you. No one could come close to being you even if they tried.
Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience, and two people who truly want to be together.
Eventually the day comes when you stop missing someone and start feeling sorry for them instead.
The people who are still with you at the end of the day are the ones worth keeping.
RT : Malaysians don't need to ask for the menu at mamak corners because we always order the same thing.
Be amazing. Be good. Be pretty. Be strong. Be smart. Be cool. But the most important thing is, be yourself.
RT : Collège de Valleyfield, Quebec, Canada 
Every girl deserves a guy who looks at her everyday like its the first time he saw her.
U lied? I cried. U flirt? I hurt. U forgot? I remembered. U promised? I kept it. U were done? I was trying. You love me? Stop lying.
A real man treats his lady the same way he wants another man to treat his daughter.
I might not text you first, but that doesn't mean I'm not dying to talk to you.
A hug means I need you. A kiss means I love you. A call means I miss you.
Forget those who made you cry, remember you still have thousand of people who would make you smile.
The ones who give the best advice, are usually the ones who have the most problems.
Do you ever wish you had a second chance to meet someone again for the first time?
Life ends when you stop dreaming. Hope ends when you stop believing. Love ends when you stop caring. So, dream, hope and love.
你可明白，如果有一天我不折腾了不闹了，那代表着什么。
I don't hate you. I'm just disappointed you turned into everything you said you'd never be.
A smile doesn't always mean a person is happy. Sometimes it simply means they are strong enough to face their own problems.
Never frown even when you're sad 'cause you never know when someone's falling in love with your smile.
You can't stop loving someone, but if they're bad for you, then you need to leave them, and love them from a distance.
You will never be truly happy if you continuously hold on to the things that make you sad. Let things go and move on.
很多时候你以为他对你好，其实他对很多人都好；有时候你以为他对你最好，其实他对很多人都比你更好；有时候你以为你对他很重要，其实很多人对他而言比你重要的多。
If your girlfriend is pretty &amp; alot of guys want her, thats another reason to treat her right. At least you got what they can't have!
In life, I have made a lot mistakes and I have felt a lot of pain, but mistakes make me smarter and pain makes me stronger.
I hate when you think you're really important to someone, then you see them hanging out and having fun 24/7 with someone else.
If your relationship has more issues than your magazine, you need to cancel your subscription.
Sometimes it's not the song that makes you emotional, it's the people and things that come to your mind when you hear it.

Before I go to sleep I always picture what it would be like to fall asleep in your arms. It's probably the best feeling in the world.
Don't worry about your haters. They are just confused admirers who can't understand why many people love you.
Just remember that sometimes, the way you think about a person isn't the way they actually are.
PThere are three reasons why people change: First, they've learned a lot. Two, they've been hurt too much. Three, they met new people.
There are two things you should never waste your time on: things that don’t matter and people that think you don’t matter.
I wish my book of life was written in pencil There are a few pages I would like to erase.
Unfortunately, we all have that one person we'd take back any second... no matter how much they hurt us in the past
Let the right people into your life, and begin to remove those who are slowing you down.
Surround yourself with the people who make you better, and you will have better outcomes.
I wanna write "I miss you" on a rock and throw it at your face so you know how much it hurts to miss you.
I want to be the girl who makes your bad days better and who makes you say my life has changed since I've been with her.
The person you took for granted today, may turn out to be the person you need tomorrow.
Nothing in this life is easy. Don't expect things to be given to you; you have to go out and get it.
The boyfriends who still hold bags, open doors, tell their girlfriends they're beautiful and show respect are real men.

Be fearless when it comes to life, and careless when it comes to what people say and think about you.

People will judge you no matter what you do... So you might as well do what you want.
Surround yourself with positive people who will support you during your bad days, not just your good days.
 mind to follow me back? ^^
My mind is saying "forget that person". My heart is saying "Don't let go".
Sometimes you will never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory.
Take the time every day to be thankful for everything that you have. You can always have more, but you could also have less.
If you fight like a married couple, talk like best friends, flirt like first loves, protect each other like family, it's meant to be.
Always know the difference between what you're getting and what you deserve.
There is a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Think about that before you judge someone.
I get jealous because I'm afraid someone is going to make you happier than I do.
If it doesn't matter, don't let it stress you out. Stay happy and focus on what truly does matter.
It's better to be single with high standards than in a relationship settling for less.
If a girl is silent, it's dangerous. They're either: about to blow up, need a hug, falling apart, crying inside or all of the above.
OMG ! 这张照片！好可爱哦！猜猜那一个是我吧 XD

Sometimes the most happy moment is when you realize that there are people who truly care about us.
I want you. All of you. Your flaws. Your mistakes. Your imperfections. I want you, and only you.
No matter how much it hurts right now. one day you'll look back and realize it changed your life for the better.
I don't even feel like a "friend" to some people. I feel more like an option or someone they run to when they need something.
You have to accept whatever comes and the only important thing is that you meet it with courage and with the best that you have to give.
Every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is if you still want to be together when things go wrong.
It's not what you have in your life, it's who you have in your life that counts.
Every girl has her bestfriend, boyfriend, and true love. But you're really lucky if they're all the same person.
I'd rather live my life knowing that I'm not perfect, rather than spending my whole life pretending to be.
You are never too busy to take time out of your day for those who matter most. You can always make time.
The best feeling comes when you realize you're perfectly happy without the people you thought you needed the most.
You can't always wait for the perfect time. Sometimes, you have to dare to do it because life is too short to wonder what could have been.
People spend too much time looking for more, instead of appreciating what they already have.
Feelings that come back are feelings that never went away in the first place.
The worst part of life is waiting. The best part of life is having someone worth waiting for.
We all have that one person we will always have feelings for, no matter what.
Don't ever say you're not good enough. If that person can't see how amazing you are, then they're the one who's not good enough for you.
Don't confuse my personality with my attitude. My personality is who I am. My attitude depends on who you are.
Her favorite kind of hug is one from behind when you wraps your arms around her waist when she least expect it.
Sometimes we fall down because there is something down there we're supposed to find.
Sometimes those bad days are there to remind you that you have good ones to look forward to.
Sometimes it's not about missing someone. It's wondering if they're missing you.
The past is behind, Learn from it. The future is ahead, Prepare for it. The present is here, Live it.
Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is that you learn from them and don't repeat them.
Even though I promised myself I wouldn't risk the chance of getting hurt again, for some reason, when I'm with you, it all seems worth it.
I don't know what hurts the most, How much i'll know I'll miss you, or how much i know you won't miss me.
Real girlfriend will be on your ass, text you everyday, fight with you, cares about you, listens to you, and loves you like no girl has.
Don't worry about the things you can't change. It makes it harder to focus on the things you can.
Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you.
Touch her heart, not her body. Steal her attention, not her virginity. Make her smile, don't waste her tears.
It's hard to pretend to love someone when you don't, but its harder to pretend not to love someone when you really do.
RT : ☁☁ This is what I wanna do. ☁☁ 
Do you ever just want to pack up and leave out of the blue without saying anything to anyone like just leave and start a new life.
The moment you feel like you have to prove your worth to someone is the moment to absolutely and utterly walk away.
The best feeling comes when you realize you're perfectly happy without the people you thought you needed the most.
