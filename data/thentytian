RT : 有时候，一个人想要的只是一只可以握的手和一颗可以理解的心。
RT : 可以影响你心情的人，在你心里一定很重要吧。
": 有时候我们原谅一个人 有多少个是能真心原谅 说白了只是不想失去他 藏在心中的每一根刺 但愿能随着时光流逝而被慢慢磨平 毕竟是我爱的人 我能够怪你什么"
RT : 你不知道，我的心情一直被你左右。有时候，躲避是为了让自己不那么失望。
": 爱情不在于说多少次“我爱你”，而在于怎样去证明你说的是真的。"
RT : 马年，我要我的家人都整整齐齐，健健康康，快快乐乐，幸幸福福的在一起。

RT : 随着年龄的增长，我们并不是失去了一些朋友，而是我们懂得了谁才是真正的朋友。
RT : Life is a test but unfortunately I didn't study.
RT : I'm glad I met you, I hope you know that.
RT : Before you go and criticize #Gemini, remember, you've got your own imperfections too.
RT : Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually.
RT : 
RT : dengan mudahnya kamu menyakiti hati mereka (wanita) karena kamu tak tau bagaimana sakitnya disakiti #KamusCewek
RT : Don't keep crying because of a mistake. Learn from it and move on. Stop blaming yourself over things you have no control …
RT : I hate acting like I don't care when it's really tearing me up inside.
": wanita tidak akan meneteskan air matanya jika hatinya tidak terluka #KamusCewek"
RT : Once I care about you, I will never stop.
RT : I hate opening a text that I know is going to make my heart drop.
RT : When people remember small details about you &gt;
RT : You change for two reasons: either you learn enough that you want to or you've been hurt enough that you have to.
RT : I want to meet someone who is afraid to lose me.
RT : Have patience and everything will resolve itself.
": I want our relationship to be like Tom and Jerry. No matter how many times we fight, we won't be apart."
": Its how you "Do it" not how you say it #GeminisWeAre "
RT : A real boyfriend always makes sure his girl has a smile on her face. 👌

": Naturally, a Gemini person loves freedom, knowledge and every aspect of life. #GeminisWeAre"

RT : #Gemini are so moody but they will apologize for it if it bothered you. #GeminisWeAre
RT : If I'm weird around you, that means I'm comfortable with you..
RT : When guys get jealous, it's kinda cute.

When girls get jealous, World war III is about to start.

": 真希望有个真心懂我的人，就算我不说出口，你也会明白我的感受。"
RT : 你之所以会痛苦，是因为脆弱的你看到了可怜的自己。
RT : 小时候，都希望快点长大。当长大后才发现，小时候其实是最幸福的。
RT : 我想这世上只有自己才明白自己的烦恼，在旁人眼中看来的我们永远都是自寻烦恼。悲哀呀。
RT : 不需要自卑，因为每个人都有失败的时候。
RT : 在微笑的背后，其实我并不快乐。
RT : 其实男人的心也是海底针。
RT : 我不想失去你...
RT : 我要稳稳的幸福。
RT : 心情总是随着有些事有些话而改变
RT : 我把快乐挂在脸上，把伤痛藏在心里，我的表情可以表达千种心情，但那最伤最痛的部分，别人又怎么能轻易看得到。
RT : 如果能回到过去 我会选择不认识很多人。
RT : 对不起，这是我的心里话。
RT : 有时候，虽然能想明白，但心里就是接受不了。
RT : 很多时候，你不说，我也不说。就这样，说着说着就变了，想着想着就算了。
RT : 简单的事，想深了，就复杂了。复杂的事，看淡了，就简单了。有些事，笑笑就能过去。有些事，过一阵就能让你笑笑。
RT : 谈恋爱吵架很正常，但不要轻易放手。
RT : 不要为了任何人委屈自己，卑微不是你该有的，记得左手牵着你的原则，右手握住你的心。
RT : A girl, no matter how many times she denies it, she will always remember every detail, memories &amp; moment you've left her. ❤
RT : 说好了，你忘了。
RT : some nights I just feel like... crying
RT : 如果我尽力了，你还觉得不足够，那么对不起。
RT : 除了你自己，没有人会明白你的故事里有过多少快乐或伤悲，因为那终究只是你一个人的感觉。
RT : 有些故事不一定要讲给每个人听，有些悲伤不一定谁都会懂。宁愿放在心里埋起来，再疼也不说出来。
RT : 如果一个男人真爱你，永远不会丢下你，不管情形有多难。
RT : 女人的心，一般不会死在大事上，而是那些一次一次的小失望，成了致命伤。
RT : 我以为，真心对人，也可以换来别人真心对待。拼了命的不让身边的人难过，却发现，受伤的原来是我自己。
RT : 喜欢一个人，就是在一起很开心。爱一个人，就是即使不开心，也想在一起。
RT : wanita menangis bukan karena dia cengeng,tapi biasanya karena batinnya tersiksa #KamusCewek
RT : If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you.
": I'll pretend I'm okay with all and act like there's nothing wrong."
RT : You don't really need someone to complete you. You only need someone to accept you completely.

RT : I wish you could understand the way I feel about you.
RT : #Gemini is strong enough to remain faithful while in a relationship.
RT : I love being a Gemini #GeminisWeAre
RT : Women generally give up… not because they lose interest but simply because they’re tired of feeling unappreciated.
RT : I just want someone to be real with me.
RT : Generally, you forgive people simply because you still want them in your life.
RT : Psychology says, no matter how angry you get, you always end up forgiving the people you love.
