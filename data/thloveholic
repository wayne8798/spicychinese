我单恋着你三年了，该适可而止了。
让我爱上他好吗？
Back to square one. I still don't want to take relationships too seriously.
害怕太过喜欢一个人。
I'm slowly realizing my feelings for you.
Teatime @ Paris Baguette ♥ 
我们都傻...
喜欢却不能在一起，我经历了多少次。
Finally that motivation is back within me.
为何你总是口是心非，坦率一点很难吗。
My sister told me to marry to Malaysian guys because they have great taste in fashion. -Reminds me of my colleagues- Not quite right, haha.
It has all come to an end.
Farewell gifts for the lovely colleagues! ♥ 
I miss my bed ever since the first day of internship.
Finally finish baking and packing cookies at this timing! ^ ^
Didn't expect to have a Valentine's chocolate exchange with the boy c:
Too many leftover pineapple tarts at my workplace. Anyone want some?
You don't think you're wrong. I've got nothing more to say.
'Give me one good reason to give you my number', seriously laughing at the 'whyareyoulikethat' expression on the boy's face, hehehe (:
There's so many things I wanna do after my internship. Work hard, play hard I guess ♥
The boy hinted me to say to him 'I need you'.
It's not right to be together with a guy who you're happy and comfortable spending time with. Many other things matters.
Sometimes you can't find back the feeling and chemistry for a guy, only the memories stays.
It's been long since I last talked to kor kor. I'm glad that he sounded fine and was laughing over the phone ☺
为什么把感情看得那么重
想成为好朋友这么困难
爱你难 不爱你也难
只害怕我对你的这份‘喜欢‘久了就演变成朋友之间的‘喜欢‘
I know it's sweet to have the boy making his first move by feeding me with food. I must have hated myself for not feeling that way.
What to feel for a guy who loves me more than I love him...
The boy gets so lazy after knowing me. He's wanting me to do everything for him now. -beathim-
 爸妈这样我永远长不大
I feel sorry for my colleagues. It's always what happened the previous night that makes me all so sulky at work D:
No rights, no freedom. Seriously you're controlling too much of my life already.
 Haha happy cny too! I'll whatsapp you (:
我怀念以前的我。
So damn tired and depressed.
Clock is ticking but I'm not doing anything about my life.
Makes me wanna cry.
Just two more weeks. I am going to pull through it.
*stares at my logbook*
-SIGH-
*pushes it aside and back to my laptop*
两个人在一起不应该计较谁付出的比较多。始终都会有一方喜欢另一方多一点。
Have to do my one month of weekly reflections already. Really cannot procrastinate anymore ):
Most photogenic ♥ 
Paranoid.
Cute little puppy! ☺😘😍 
I will smile whenever I think of the joke shared between the boy and I. I want all the good memories (:
Maybe I should move out of my comfort zone and start a relationship.
The boy is gonna miss me for four days. I'm expecting a new year gift from him ☺
再靠近一点点 就让你牵手
再勇敢一点点 我就跟你走
你还等什么 时间已经不多
再下去 只好只做朋友
Why is my phone charging so slowly?
Is it time for me to throw away my S3? T.T

I'm happy to see my lovely classmates back in school! ^ ^
    😊☺😉
I don't know what to feel.
So many thoughts running through my mind.
I'm tired already.
Too bad but I've decided to pester my colleagues until my last day of internship even if you guys already find my voice annoying :P
The boy is so alike to me. He's someone who kept on laughing even before he can share the joke with me (:
Sometimes I really dislike attending to my phone. Replying to whatsapp is tedious and what's more charging my phone the whole night &gt;:
Pretty pineapple tarts ♥ 
Dying from flu already 😷
Too many people broke my heart and left my life.
I always end up having a love hate relationship with close guy friends. Why.
I wish you had cared more for my feelings. It's so tiring to quarrel with you on every alternate days and having to make up all the time.
When paired up with a close guy friend:
A. Be together as a couple
B. Negative impact on friendship
I wish there was a C. Nothing changed.
I wish love will not hurt friendships. But 99.9% it does have a negative effect.
I like you and hate you at the same time.
We're so near yet our thoughts are miles apart.
I like having the boy as a friend. We had the same past experience and hence our similar personalities ☺
Patiently waiting with my growling stomach. Daddy could you please come home fast with my food?
RT : 白羊总是在大家面前大笑大叫，不顾形象，为的就是给朋友快乐。最常说的"随便"并不是没主见，而是你们高兴就好，自己完全无所谓。独处时，却又总是抱着膝盖坐在床上，想这想那，直至深夜甚至凌晨。白羊从来都只会把快乐带给别人，把脆弱的一面留给自己，…
RT : 处女座独自一人的时候会迷茫拿著手机不知道做什么。处女座和不熟悉的人在一起很斯文不说话会给人很好的感觉，但一熟悉起来你会发现处女的单纯和没有长大的心、却又爱玩什麼都敢尝试 处女懒的连下楼买早餐都嫌烦。房间永远乱乱的却给人舒适感。 好好珍惜…
I fell asleep while gaming. Alright time to sleep 😪
You hurt my feelings, you hurt my pride.
When will you realize you haven't been saying the right things?
I'm having a love-hate relationship with you.
I'm losing interest in you so no doubt I'm finding another guy who is worth my time.
Oh no, the boy and I have been crossing our limits. We are suppose to remain as friends or colleagues...
I don't really want to get into a relationship.
One reason.
'You deserve a better girl.'
'What do you think of the boy?'
I haven't really got an answer to that.
Short hair works wonders. More energetic, light and cooling, dries easily and most importantly less burden :D
Friends who I didn't meet up with for months or years really did changed a lot. I saw that their lives have been better.
我为何这么坚持，执着，放不下你？
我只希望你还记得我，偶尔想想我。
这些就足够了。
我只是存催的喜欢你。我喜欢你的阳光，你的笑容。想看见你，想跟你说说话，想跟你相处久一点。你在我心里是个很重要的男生。但不巧的是命运不让我们俩旧情复燃，而机会一旦错失了就回不来了。
The boy plays well with me and does all the cute actions~ I'm 20, he's 24 but we both act like we're 16 &lt;3
I forbid myself to work together with the boy already. He's getting all the blurness from me, haha XD
I find the boy really special because so far he's the only guy who look at my flaws and imperfections. He's someone who accept who I am.
Finally done with my logbook till the latest reflection, I really hate not doing it every week ):
If I can talk a lot to a guy one to one, it means I don't feel awkward with him even if we're not yet that close.
It's funny seeing how my colleagues adviced the boy and I to be on low profile during work. We haven even started dating, haha.
Running around the kitchen the whole day. My schedule is fully pack so as to be able to end work on time!
The boy and I can't work or play too closely together if we still want to see each other at work everyday -sigh-
It's heartbrokening hearing you said 'what do you want me to do?' because obviously you haven't realize your mistake yet.
我应不应该喜欢上你呢？
可是我们之间的问题总是没完没了。
Why haven't you learn to appreciate the time and effort I put into you? Don't always make me give in to you.
I wasn't angry but disappointed. For one thing, we're pretty sure that we are not as important in each other's life.
I don't know what is wrong with the boy today. Will you talk to me tomorrow?
Guys are so much easier to talk to. You don't even have to think on how to start a conversation with them. That's what I like about them.
It's always the same problem when it comes to friends. I wish you guys had known me better ):
I was so happy that I had a good sleep last night, in a good mood and had a wonderful time with my colleagues at work (:
The boy anyhow assumed the reason for my moodiness. '你肯定是失恋了'. I smiled at his foolishness.
I feel sorry for neglecting the boy in the morning but at least we cleared our misunderstanding at the end of the day.
 I don't know but I always think that there will be a one sided love to it.
Please just tell me that boy-girl friendship still exists.
My colleagues keep telling me that flirting with a guy who likes you is wrong. It made me think that have I been leading people all along?
A boy shouldn't let the girl knows that he likes her before he confess. It's making the friendship awkward.
It's so funny to have my colleague say that I need to have seven boyfriends, one for each day, seeing that I get bored of people so easily.
Samsung ATIV Book 9 Lite seems good enough for a new laptop. I can start saving up now &lt;:
I'm pretty lazy to go out but whatever since my colleagues are treating me.
回忆随着眼泪消失
Nothing new to be expected in 2014. I'm still going to live the same as of right now.
I hate to say that I get bored of people very easily but what to do when I'm meeting my colleagues for work and now on my off days too.
RT : 有些东西失去后才懂得珍惜，可是当你要在一次珍惜，时间不对人走了也不能再拥有了。
The boy started a conversation with me ten over times and asked me out thrice. I just don't wana give you a definite answer :P
The boy ask if I want him to be nice or naughty towards me. Honestly speaking I prefer the bad guys than the gentlemen.
I can naturally do skinship with guys I'm close with. Damn, I feel like a bad girl ):
My colleagues were patting on my head like FOC. It was only meant for my close and special guys, haih.
Automatically waking up at this timing. Are you telling me my body clock only let me sleep for 5 hours?
看到你开心快乐，我是该放弃你了。
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand 
I gotta leave but I'll miss you 
#nowplaying
你还是不要做我的男朋友好了，我不想你辛苦。
Too many people thought that I'm cheerful and optimistic. None of you know that not even my family has ever seen the weak side of me.
I smile, I laugh and I joke with everyone when I'm at work. But it doesn't mean that I won't start worrying about other things at night.
可能我以前喜欢过你吧。因为我还是会想念你，为你掉泪，我自己都不明白为什么。只是想着我们为什么连朋友都做不成？
What is with this sudden light sleep since last week. It's getting annoying.
Talked on the phone for one hour with my colleague just because he wants to listen to my voice, why are you so funny? XD
一旦我们变得要好，我们就不可能在一起了。
I feel loved by all my colleagues. I'm happy that I've met them in my life c:
It's so funny when kor kor self claims that he is good looking and was confident that most of the girls goes for looks.
Kor kor definitely don't look like he is in his thirties. He's a fashionista with a baby face.
It's heartwarming when kor kor entrusted me with his secret. It makes me feel that I'm special and a close friend to him &lt;3
Finally meeting Kai Kai kor kor tmrw after 3 weeks! Missed him ♥
The love lines seems like a square love already.
My dear boy shyly tells me that he will miss not seeing me for two days straight. He couldn't admit that he's suffering from lovesickness.
我们只是爱斗嘴，爱打情骂俏，但我们变成了大家眼中的情侣。
你可以用行为举止表示你不在乎我，但不要在我面前对我说你不想在乎我。你明白这样有多伤人吗？
I smile, I laugh and I cry. It's all about growing up.
The good times with you aren't able to cover the bad times.
Words came up to my mouth but I just didn't have the courage to ask you.
It's pretty scary when my colleague wanna join the dinner with my friend. Did you not feel shy when you ask?
Kor kor texted me saying he misses me too much, aww so sweet ^ ^
我怕我们只能做朋友了
最近我是怎么了
好累 好空虚
我好想拥有你的乐观
我不是讨厌你 我只是没喜欢上你
I share the same thought as the boy.
'It's best making friends with those who are singles.'
But they aren't going to stay single forever.
It's not that I'm not giving you a chance. It's just that I'm not giving myself a chance to fall for you.
Omg so many shippers who shipped me and the boy. Hello we aren't here for matchmaking -laughedsohard- ^ ^
It's week 8 from tmrw onwards, okay I'm almost done with half of my internship.
The boy taught me too many things this week. I want him to help me write the 600 words reflection that I typed out D:
该选择 ‘你爱的人‘ 还是 ‘爱你的人‘ ?
I've not dated a guy before. Why no one wants to believe the truth?
Was I bored because the boy took a half day leave? I guess it's because usually he was the noisy one.
我该如何看待你 你告诉我好吗?
I like how I interact with boys. To me it isn't flirting while everyone sees it as it is.
  Wah your lameness never deprove leh! Why am I not surprise, haha.
  Because if I don't go school or study, I got no life leh. You all got more life.
It's funny how my colleagues all said that the boy and I will fall for each other. We are just playing a lot with each other that's all.
  You two busier than me loh. You all should know why -hint hint-
Now then I realized why yesterday was memorable for everyone because its 11/12/13.
-Slow-
  Then like that can meet on Sundays ah since I can take any day off ^ ^
  This sunday I also not free. You got standard off day not?
  He's my gan kor kor loh. You standard Sunday free is it? Jw having holiday now so cfm free, haha XD
  YK I was referring to you loh. My that colleague I call him kor kor liao.
Only just reached home when I'm supposed to be in bed already :c
  Haha I've never met ah kai outside school before leh. We all find one day come out loh! (:
Replying to kor kor's texts made me miss him more. Oh no.
The funniest colleague came back to visit us on his off day! Poor kor kor was busy on his own at jurong c:
It's been so long since I last touched a bread dough. First bread making lesson was fun - taught by the boy ^ ^
 I will go back school and visit you soon! Must wait for me kay (:
心累了, 不想说了
Memory really failing till I left my phone in the toilet cubicle twice already! D:
I'm jealous how my boy has very neat and pretty chinese handwriting. I admire boys with nice handwritings (:
Another close colleague leaving for another outlet tmrw. Now it's only me and the boy. Kor kor faster come back! :c
There are reasons why I don't like to hang out with girls. Why are you so clingy?! &gt;:
Now I know why most of the time I feel so disheartened to go to work.
I haven't seen my didi  for months already D:
Wishing the boy to recover soon. It's really weird not having you being talkative like usual.
My colleague said that the worst thing he had done this year was getting to know me. What a meanie, haha.
It's really funny how by right I should have age gap with those adult colleagues but we're having so much fun talking about life.
The boy is just as stubborn as me. Refuse to go and see the doctor despite my constant nagging, haih.
虽然我已经忘了和你的回忆, 我依然感受得到那莫名的悲伤.
Kor kor replied this to my other guy colleague: 'you aren't a girl so why should I exchange number with you?'. Damn joke.
The boy is waiting for me to brew herbal tea and bring to work for him. Poor thing that he is having a swollen throat now.
Kor kor learned the bad things from the bad boy. You're suppose to be nice to me but now you like to disturb me like he do.
-sigh-
No chemistry between us. Even holding hands won't do the trick.
My dear boy looked tired and says he's been thinking of me every night until 1am when usually he was already asleep at 10pm ):
 If is a close guy friend I find it okay lah. It's not like we're doing what couples do.
 Haha because my colleagues all very funny?
 You left 6 weeks of internship must endure ah!
Where to find another nice guy like him? Too bad I don't have a crush on you ):
Bad boy who likes to do skinship with me whenever he can. Need to bring a cane to work to cane him already, haha ^ ^
Xiao ye definitely never seen a young girl wearing casual wear in front of him before. He's still as joke!
Never felt this tired before. I'm having dark circles around my eyes ):
I'm tired from all the sickness already, I'm taking a break.
Now everyone thinks I'm abnormal. I laugh just as much at home, in school and during work!
The others get so jealous when I help xiao ye to put on his apron. How can he not know how to wear a half apron properly? -facepalm-
My colleagues said that now is the right time to come and get me when I'm sick and I can't rebel. It's 10 vs 1 so not fair.
My chef shyly touches her hair and smile when I praised her saying that she looks cute in her short bob. How adorable is she?
I like how you always pat my head gently and start a conversation with me. You make me feel that I've met another nice guy friend (:
Patients like me is craving for porridge at this moment.
I can't stop you from showing concern towards me. You know I don't want to lead you on.
小叮铃会想你的 &lt;3
'I haven't been sleeping well all these nights.' I hope I'll be able to show my bright side to my colleagues at least for tomorrow.
We talked a lot and now we know more about each other (:
Kai Kai leaving for sembawang outlet next week. We only met for one month. /cry D:
I guess I played too much in the kitchen today, I'm regretting it.
The poor chocolate mousse cake was left forgotten in the fridge at my workplace. That was meant to be my end work dessert D:
My colleagues are treating me too nice already. Pampered me with food and milk tea almost everyday &lt;:
Kor Kor is handsome, tall and slim. Such a waste not being a model.
'Kor Kor your hair messy liao' -Takes off hat, fling his fringe and smile at me- 'Haha it's still messy'. Why this Kor Kor so cute one?!
