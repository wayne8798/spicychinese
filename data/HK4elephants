If we can take demand down by 30% in China that is huge and the price of ivory would fall. Plan is this that this would discourage poaching.
 22% of the public in China would no longer consume ivory products if the Chinese leadership denounced it.
 37% of public in China would no longer consume ivory products if the Chinese government made ivory sales illegal.
 Check out this slide, and I hope you will understand... 
HK Gov't will decide on stockpile tomorrow, but we'll not close our petition until the last tusk is destroyed...
