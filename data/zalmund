 alright I will! 😍😘
Busy isn't respectable anymore.
My problem is I can't stay mad. I always end up forgiving people, even when they don't deserve it.
:):
Don't make me lose my temper before my long weekend.
One more chance I'm giving.
My world gets bigger everyday. The more I see, the more I learn is out there.
RT : This is my very first valentine's day that I get to spend time with the person that I love the most!  😍😘
Valentine's Day should be everyday, if you truly loved your significant other. 💏❤️💯

過年回家，有人問你一個月掙多少錢，有人問你什麼時候結婚，有人問你什麼時候買房，有人問你在公司是什麼職位，卻很少有人問你：你現在過的幸福快樂嗎？

And that can lead to a hard landing.
Never mind the colour of your parachute, some people have no parachutes at all.
I can't wait for  to plan our next outing! 😍😘😚

Finally, it's a different answer this CNY ;)
You want to give everyone your undivided attention since it may be your only chance to help them.
However, attending to everyone in a timely manner can be a real challenge.
I personally love to talk to and meet new people and I get to do that for a living. What's not to love?
The best part of my job is that it is never the same. Every day I have different people with different requests. It is never boring.
 I'm guessing next Thursday or Friday, the schedule will be our on this Thursday
 have dinner/lunch with me!
Desire -&gt; beliefs -&gt; expectations

Does the prospect of a holiday with no access to the digital world fill you with horror, or do you think it's a blissful idea?

In fact, some of our wants are so strong that; if the goal is happiness and a sense of fulfillment, we turn them into needs.
The line that defines want from need is often blurry.
The problem is, we have a difficult time differentiating between the two.
We all want so very much, but need so very little.
 😍😘😚
What's a good reason to wake up early, even during off days?
So many more work days before off days..

No resolutions, just a somewhat realistic, achievable goal for 2014: to appreciate things more and to be better/happier in life.
