RT : If tomorrow never comes 
Guess I was afraid. But if you had seen these tweets, you would be even more hurt because of what I have placed upon you.
How could I say that you didn't love me then? How could I bear to say that the love will fade when you did so much for me?
And I recall at that time, you were suppose to head home as soon as it ended to see your parents on your bday. But you chose to stay.
I remember we walked up and down, trying to decided whether to go there or not. And whether to go home or not.
But I'll make a trip back before it closes. I will

Choices. Is this the right choice?
So I'll make sure, to keep my distance. Say I love you, when you're not listening.
Meeting her tomorrow 😍😍😍 and no, it's not the one on my display picture. I wish lol.
After 7-8 years of trying to get close to her, how could I not rub off any of her mannerisms? 😂😂😂
It is a form of self-medication. That figured.
It's crazy how memories can be shaped to become like this. Could some of my memories be fake?
Crazy. It's crazy how they put these events that didn't happen in the families into the children's brains. It's crazy.

The first and the last, other than for my future husband.
 LOL hahahah
You're the only one that I'll do this much. Cos I know I won't be able to for anyone else.
Even if it takes years for you to realise that I've change and I love you unconditionally too, I will fight this battle.
Because you persisted through the beginning of time when I was cold, I will continue to fight this battle.

RT : We're just ordinary people
And yes , I can't seem to fall back asleep after being woken up slightly.
I know why after so much of being strong, I had to eventually break down and cry.
I don't wish to bring any more hurt towards you. But any form of love right now is hurt in your eyes.
All I want to do right now, is to love you. That's it.
I guess even if I had the chance to turn back the clock, I prob might have done the same thing.
RT : Better to let someone walk away from you than all over you.

Best valentine's day ever spent with the most people ever. ( includes God definitely)
Love is painful. Love hurts. If it doesn't, you haven't loved enough.
Rt  :Trying to remind myself that it's all temporary.
I'm glad I did. With Him. I know why I needed to.

And no, I don't mean to say anything bad about this. I'm just describing how it feels like.
Never felt this heartbroken since last month. And it's not the heartbroken of the worldly kind of love. It's the heartbroken of abandonment.
