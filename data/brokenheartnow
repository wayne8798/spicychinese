RT : 【十二星座的眼泪代表着什么意思】
天蝎座——硫酸
天蝎座不喜欢掉眼泪，也不轻易掉眼泪，他们更多的时候是想隐藏自己的情绪。然而当有一天他们流下了眼泪，必定是天崩地裂，非同小可，这时的眼泪完全是天蝎座愤怒和悲痛的混合液，杀伤力犹如一瓶浓硫酸。

我恨我愛你
當我唱起這首歌//
以為還是昨天 可是昨天已非常遙遠
還能溫暖我胸口
走失那路口
以為在你身邊 那也算永遠
可惜不是你陪我到最後
Baby I'm sorry.
我會永遠在你身邊
我也會努力忘記她
你說的我都懂。
只是我太愛她
永遠好遙遠
最近你好嗎

當我唱起這首歌
我又想起你了
還記得那年
我們都很快樂
RT : I want a relationship that everyone is jealous of.
RT : 你以為他的主動
就是喜歡你嗎？
你以為你難過痛哭了
他會在意嗎？
你以為消失不見了
他就會發狂去找你嗎？
你以為對他癡情
他就會給你愛情嗎？
你以為把青春擱他身上
他就不會讓你輸嗎？

呵呵 別傻了
