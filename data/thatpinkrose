You used to let me feel happy and loved, but now all i ever felt is sadness and disappointments.
If i get into an accident and lose my memory and forgotten about you, please don't tell me that i know you.

This isn't love.
B'cos i know that if i were to walk away, you won't chase after me anymore.

No more expectations, so there wouldn't be disappointments too.
“: Yes ”

of
my
head.””
“: Aren't your spare tire or substitutes okay.”
